Here's the historical context on Zhu Yuanzhang siege of Suzhou (Zhang Shicheng's territory). Current timeframe is September 1366:

"Before launching a final attack on the enemy's heartland, the Suzhou region, Zhu and his generals decided to first "cut off the wings" of Wu by occupying the territory north of the Yangtze and the Wu part of Zhejiang. Xu Da was appointed as the supreme commander of the attacking troops, and the plan was executed with ease due to the attacking army's superiority. The ten-month siege of Suzhou began in December 1366."

We've already wrote the following facts (some of it):

"Zhu's started with cutting off Zhang from any possible aid from the Yuan rulers in the north. This was accomplished by his taking Gaoyou on the Grand Canal of China on April 24, 1366. In the same year (1366), Zhang lost his younger brother Zhang Shide, who was also an important general in his army, feared by Zhu's troops, when the younger Zhang fell from his horse and died. By late December 1366, Zhang's capital Suzhou was surrounded by Zhu's army."

Currently, our Murong Bing is already Xu Da's wife, (almost) inline with the following fact:

Wives and Issue:
- Lady, of the Zhang clan (張氏)

We've made Murong Bing a Zhang Wuji's adoptive younger sister named 'Zhang Bing' before.

Xu Da's family structure (as recorded by historical source) is:

**Wives and Issue:**

- Lady, of the Zhang clan (張氏)
- Madame Wang of Zhongshan, of the Xie clan (中山王夫人 謝氏), daughter of Xie Zaixing (謝再興)
  + Xu Yihua, Empress Renxiaowen (仁孝文皇后 徐儀華; 5 March 1362 – 6 August 1407), 1st daughter
    - Married Zhu Di, 5th son of Hongwu Emperor, in 1736 and had issue (4 daughters and 3 sons)
  + Xu Huizu, Duke Zhongzhen of Wei (徐輝祖 忠贞魏国公; 1368–1407), 1st son
  + Xu Tianfu (徐添福),[4] 2nd son
  + Xu Zengshou, Duke of Ding (徐增壽 定國公; d. 1402), 3rd son
  + Lady Xu, Princess Consort of Dai (徐氏 代王妃; d. 1427), 2nd daughter
    - Married Zhu Gui, 13th son of Hongwu Emperor, and had issue (3 sons)
  + Lady Xu, Princess Consort of An (徐氏 安王妃; d. 1449), 3rd daughter
    - Married Zhu Ying, Prince of Ai, 22nd son of Hongwu Emperor
- Lady, of the Sun clan (孫氏)[5]
  + Xu Yingxu (徐膺緒; 1372 – 2 March 1416), 4th son
- Lady, of the Jia clan (賈氏)
  + Xu Miaojin (徐妙锦),[6] 4th daughter

So, since there's no official record about this "Lady, of the Zhang clan (張氏)"'s personal name, then our Murong Bing can indeed posed as her. She bore Xu Da no children either.
