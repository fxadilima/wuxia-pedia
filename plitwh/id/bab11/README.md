**Hstorical events in 1362:**

1. Red Turban Rebellion: Chaghan Temür is murdered by rebels while on his way to Yidu.
2. Köke Temür, nephew of Chaghan Temür, captures Yidu and takes control of northern China from Shandong to Shanxi.

Quoted from some historical accounts (on Zhu Yuanzhang):

"Zhu insisted that he was not a rebel, and he attempted to justify his conquest of the other rebel warlords by claiming that he was a Yuan subject divinely-appointed to restore order by crushing rebels. Most Chinese elites did not view the Yuan's Mongol ethnicity as grounds to resist or reject it. Zhu emphasized that he was not conquering territory from the Yuan dynasty but rather from the rebel warlords. He used this line of argument to attempt to persuade Yuan loyalists to join his cause."

In this story, the above stance is exactly what Zhang Wuji told him, and he did exactly like he was told.

Also in this story, Zhu Yuanzhang is copying Zhang Wuji's 'Embroidered Uniform Secret Police', while in historical context, Zhu Yuanzhang finally *did* have this kind of special force, to spy on his own former allies, paranoidly.

We are now in October 1361. The warzone situation is as follow (quoted from historical text):

"In the beginning of 1360, Zhu controlled the southwestern part of Jiangsu, all of Anhui south of the Yangtze River, and the inland of Zhejiang. By 1393, these territories had a population of 7.8 million. The domain (known as the Kingdom of Wu since 1363), led by Zhang Shicheng, had comparable power with a larger population but worse organization. Chen Youlang's state of Han had a similar situation.[36] The state of Han, located west of Zhu's territory, included the provinces of Jiangxi and Hubei. Zhang, based in Suzhou, controlled the lower reaches of the Yangtze, from the eastern borders of Zhu's dominions to the sea. While Zhu, Zhang, and Chen divided up the Yangtze River Basin, the rest of southern and central China was largely under the control of "one-province" regimes. Fang Guozhen controlled the eastern Chinese coast, Ming Yuzhen ruled in Sichuan, and the trio of Yuan loyalists (Chen Youding, He Zhen, and Basalawarmi) controlled Fujian, Guangdong, and Yunnan. These provincial regimes were unable to threaten the "big three", but were strong in defense."

Not long after 1363, the rivalry between Zhang Shicheng and Zhu Yuanzhang would escalate, started by Zhang Shicheng declare himself a King of Wu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Shicheng#Regional_rule, (Wu Wang).

This is possibly inspired by Zhu Yuanzhang himself, who, at some point in 1361, make himself Duke of Wu (吴公, Wu Gong).

So, in our current timeframe (1361), we should now foreshadow this event.

"Information Gathering: They will need more information about the situation in Taiyuan (why is Yin Li trapped?) and the immediate threat to Kaifeng. Zhang Wuji's Beggars' Sect connections in the region could be invaluable here."

- Yin Li trapped in Taiyuan (along with Wang Baobao):
  1. Because the emperor is deliberately make them stay, to get Bolad Temur's attention out from Shandong, but this is obviously does not effective, Bolad Temur saw his trap, and simply ignore it.
  2. Because Chaghan Temur himself wanted them to stay away from Kaifeng, the dangerous zone
  3. They don't feel like fulfilling their duty to make an impression like they are a threat to Bolad Temur's territory, Shanxi, if they leave the place now.

  So this is actually complicated, especially because Chaghan Temur himself wanted everyone he love to stay out of the dangerous zone, while he fight to his death. Set aside Zhao Min, who is his beloved daughter.

*We are getting closer to the death of Chaghan Temur, which we should make it feels dramatic. But for now, it is the perfect time to have a closer look at Shandong and also Zhao Min and Ayushiridara.*

*Let's imagine what Shandong looks like during the chaotic time of the late Yuan Dynasty. Actually, historical context says that Chaghan Temur has been assasinated on his way to Yidu. This place's name is ambigious. But likely is the place in Shandong, not in Western Hubei. Tell me more about it.*

Okay, how far it is from the residence of Confusius's decendants located at Shandong?

The main residence of Confucius's direct descendants, the Kong Family Mansion (孔府), is located in Qufu (曲阜), which is a city in the southwestern part of Shandong province.

The distance between Qufu and the historical Yidu (益都), which as discussed is likely the area around modern-day Qingzhou (青州) in Shandong, is roughly 250-300 kilometers (155-186 miles) by road.

Therefore, Chaghan Temur's assassination in Yidu would have occurred a significant distance away from the historical center of Confucian influence in Qufu. This reinforces the idea that while Shandong was culturally significant due to Confucius, it was also a large province with diverse and often conflicting factions during the late Yuan Dynasty. The rebels Chaghan Temur was fighting in Yidu were likely more concerned with survival and plunder than with Confucian ideals.
