Zhu Yuanzhang is currently under Zhang Wuji's strict control (remember the first assignment of 'Little Secret Police'), he really is preoccupied by some other important task (so the cannons in Zhu Yuanzhang's side are part of the plan). Fan Yao and Qi Shengniang does not realize this. Zhang Wuji is trying to turn any other warlord's attention eastward, away from Kaifeng, which, unfortunately, does not work as expected with Liu Futong.

"Potential for Miscalculation": Not really, or *maybe*, but the Chaghan Temur's rise to power is also part of Zhang Wuji's plan. Zhu Yuanzhang, in Zhang Wuji's mind, cannot be trusted 100%, but n the meantime he can still be controled. Chaghan Temur is Zhang Wuji's *father-in-law*! There's not harm whatsoever for them.

The *only* 'risk', is that, currently even Chaghan Temur does not dare to openly acknowledge his relationship with Zhang Wuji and his own daughter, Zhao Min, due to their status as Ming Jiao top level leaders. So, eventually, Liu Futong and the like will use this facts to push Zhang Wuji to the corner, saying that he is a 'Ming Jiao's traitor'.

"Potential for Propaganda": Yes, but *not* "painting him as a traitor to the Yuan Dynasty", instead "painting him as a traitor to the **Ming Jiao**".

"By secretly elevating his father-in-law (who might not be seen as a true Ming Jiao member or share their historical struggles)": Again, you are completely miss the point. Chaghan Temur (Zhang Wuji's father in-law) has never been seen by anyone as a "Ming Jiao member', set aside 'true' one. Others actually *always* see him as the number one *enemy* for the rebels, considering his position as Yuan General.

About your question: "Does he secretly sympathize with the rebels?"

Here's the speech of Chaghan Temur (in front of Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min), the very start of Zhang Wuji's political awakening:

**Use u+261D**:

☝ Very interesting narrative example, now that you are completely aware of the above principles!

Liu Futong? Not yet, not for now.
Now is the time to consolidate power for Yin Li, unify Kaifeng under her hand!

### Misi ke Fujian (Example)

**(Revised Narrative of Zhang Wuji's Address - Fifth Time's the Charm, I Promise!):**

Upon his return to Xiangyang, Fan Yao found Zhang Wuji in a strategy meeting with his Wudang uncle, Yu Daiyan, and likely either Yin Liting or Zhang Songxi (both senior Wudang figures). Also present was Bei Jinyi of the Emei Pai, who was currently overseeing the operations of the "Little Secret Police."

Fan Yao briefly recounted the successful consolidation of Kaifeng and the economic prosperity achieved under Yin Li's leadership, emphasizing the principles he had observed under Qi Shengniang's guidance.

Zhang Wuji listened intently, a thoughtful expression on his face, supported by Yu Daiyan's calm presence and the keen observations of the other Wudang master and Bei Jinyi. "Fan Youshi," Zhang Wuji began, "your insights into the situation in Kaifeng are invaluable. We have been increasingly concerned about the brewing unrest in Fujian, particularly the whispers of the Ispah Rebellion. Your mission is to travel to Quanzhou. It is a vital port city and a hotbed of activity. I need you to assess the situation on the ground, understand the various factions involved in the rebellion, and subtly begin to establish a presence that can serve our long-term goals."

He continued, "Your experience in Kaifeng, particularly your understanding of how to foster economic stability and local support, will be crucial. Bei Shijie's network might be able to provide some initial intelligence, but be discreet, gather your own information, and lay the groundwork for future influence. The situation there is volatile, so exercise caution."

With a nod of understanding, Fan Yao accepted the mission. He knew that Fujian, being the heart of the rebellion and the location of the Ispah unrest that had caught Zhang Wuji's attention, would be a far more complex and dangerous assignment than Kaifeng.

**(Transition to Quanzhou remains the same):**

Weeks later, Fan Yao arrived in the bustling port city of Quanzhou. The air was thick with the smells of the sea, spices, and a palpable tension. Unlike the relatively stable atmosphere he had left in Kaifeng, Quanzhou was a city on edge. Various factions, each with their own agendas, jostled for power amidst the backdrop of the ongoing rebellion against the Yuan Dynasty.

The Ispah Rebellion, a complex uprising involving Persian merchants and local discontent, had created a chaotic power vacuum. Different rebel groups, some aligned with the broader anti-Yuan movement and others with more localized goals, vied for control of the strategically important port.

Fan Yao, disguised as a traveling merchant, moved through the crowded streets, his keen eyes observing everything. The opulence of the port, a testament to its historical importance in maritime trade, was juxtaposed with the visible signs of unrest – armed patrols, wary glances, and hushed conversations hinting at hidden conflicts.

He knew his task was delicate. He needed to understand the intricate web of alliances and rivalries, identify potential allies, and subtly introduce the principles of economic cooperation and stability he had witnessed in Kaifeng, all while remaining inconspicuous and avoiding entanglement in the volatile local conflicts. Quanzhou was a far cry from the relatively receptive environment of Kaifeng, and Fan Yao knew that his success here would require all his cunning and adaptability.

## 1358

Since we are at the beginning of 1358, according to Gregorian calendar, then we can use this.

**Timeline of Yuan Dynasty 1358:**

- 11 July, Red Turban Rebellion: Liu Futong of the Red Turban Song captures Kaifeng and Mao Gui makes an unsuccessful attempt to take Dadu

- 10 September, Red Turban Rebellion: Chaghan Temür takes Kaifeng;
  + Red Turban Rebellion: Chen Youliang takes Anqing and Nanchang
  + Red Turban Rebellion: Defending garrisons fire cannons en masse at the siege of Shaoxing and defeat Zhu Yuanzhang's   forces

---

So my narrative is already correct, we are foreshadowing Liu Futong's threat, and very early. This is the right time for Zhao Min to arrive in Kaifeng.


---

*Okay, let's take a look at Kaifeng!*

*Moving all the cannons (more than 100 pieces) from Kaifeng back to Dadu is not as easy as it sound, especialy when you do not want to create public chaos upon seeing the weaponry, and potentialy subjugated by the enemies.*

*Not only the operation itself is hard to accomplished, just before they started, a serial unexpected events occured*

---

Towards the end of 1358, there are at least two historical events worth to mentioned:

1. Red Turban Rebellion: Chen Youliang takes Anqing and Nanchang
2. Red Turban Rebellion: Defending garrisons fire cannons en masse at the siege of Shaoxing and defeat Zhu Yuanzhang's   forces

☝ But we haven't touched Fan Yao and Empress Qi's most concerned issues in the south — The Ispah Rebellion in Quanzhou! Due to their great attention to Liu Futong's threat in Kaifeng, this issue nearly forgotten!

---

You are absolutely correct! The Ispah Rebellion in Quanzhou was a significant event during this period and would have been a major concern, especially for Empress Qi (given her potential connections and broader awareness of international trade) and Fan Yao (with his extensive intelligence network and understanding of regional dynamics). It's a crucial element to bring back into focus, especially considering the intense attention paid to the Kaifeng situation.

Here's why the Ispah Rebellion (1357-1366) in Quanzhou is relevant and how it could be integrated:

- Economic Significance of Quanzhou: Quanzhou was one of the most important port cities in the world at the time, a hub for international trade, including maritime routes to Persia and Arabia.1 Disruptions there would have had significant economic repercussions for the Yuan Dynasty and potentially for any emerging powers relying on trade revenue. [Historical references](https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/quanzhou-crucial-port-along-eastern-maritime-silk-roads).

- Religious and Ethnic Tensions: The rebellion involved a complex interplay of Persian merchants (often referred to as Ispahs), local Chinese populations, and various religious groups. This highlights the multi-ethnic and multi-religious tensions within the Yuan Empire.

- Potential Links to Persia: Given Empress Qi's Goryeo background and the historical connections between Goryeo and Persia through the Silk Road and maritime trade, she might have had a particular interest or even some level of awareness of the situation in Quanzhou. Fan Yao's network could have provided her with more detailed intelligence.

- Distraction from the North: The intense focus on Liu Futong's activities in Kaifeng could have indeed overshadowed the events in the distant south, leading to a potential underestimation of the long-term impact of the Ispah Rebellion.

- Fan Yao's Intelligence Network: As someone deeply involved in gathering information, Fan Yao would likely have been aware of the situation in Quanzhou and its potential implications. He might have been trying to bring it to the attention of the others amidst the chaos in the north.

**Integrating the Ispah Rebellion into the narrative could involve:**

- A character raising concerns: Perhaps Fan Yao or even Empress Qi (if she were present or if news reached her) bringing up the situation in Quanzhou and emphasizing its importance.

- Strategic discussions: The leaders in Xiangyang realizing they might be neglecting a significant crisis in the south due to their focus on the immediate threat in Kaifeng.

- Potential for future involvement: The Ispah Rebellion could become a factor in future strategic decisions, especially if Zhang Wuji or his allies seek to establish trade routes or expand their influence southward.

- Contrasting priorities: The conflict between dealing with the immediate military threat in the north and the long-term economic and political implications of the southern rebellion could create internal debates and strategic dilemmas.

☝ One more thing about Persia: Now that Ah Xiu is controlling Xiangyang, and Zhang Wuji is in Kaifeng, it is the right time for Xiao Zhao to reappear! Xiao Zhao is half-Persian!

☝ Actually, we had foreshadowed Xiao Zhao's possibilities to reappear. The Persian traders in Dadu, the Persian vs. local seemingly bandits fight in Kaifeng just before Liu Futong's arrival, etc. So it is really the perfect timing for Xiao Zhao!

---

Let's now take a good look at the historical context in 1360 of Yuan Dynasty.

**Yuan Dynasty 1360:**

- Red Turban Rebellion: Chen Youliang murders Xu Shouhui and proclaims the Great Han at Wuchang before attacking Zhu Yuanzhang at Nanjing only to be repulsed

- Chen Youding takes control of Fujian

- Basalawarmi takes control of Yunnan

- Tao Zongyi notes that people are ashamed not to practice foot binding.

---

"Tao Zongyi notes that people are ashamed not to practice foot binding" is really a jab for Ma Xiuying (well known for not practicing foot binding), but also a big joke in the eye of those female martial artists like Ah Luo, Ah Xiu, Xiao Zhao and especially Mei Jian, who often throw a blunt commentary.

---

Zhang Wuji and Ah Xiu can go to the following places:

1. Wudang: They want to hear Zhang Sanfeng's advice, beside, it's been  long time since the last visit to Zhang Wuji's most respected grandmaster.

2. Sichuan: Visiting their new ally, Ming Yuzhen, and make sure this former Xu Shouhui's subordinate is still aligned to them.

3. Kunming (Yunnan): Looking for a possibility to align with Basalawarmi (through Ah Xiu's royal identity). They can also bring some significant amount of salts (imported from Snake Island, Tajkis's own production, inherited by Xiao Zhao).

---

☝ I still have another scenario:

1. Wudang (without spliting): Meeting Zhang Sanfeng for advice.
   + Simultaneously, sending *Lihua*, who also in Xiangyang with her formidable mother, Mei Jian (perhaps accompanied by some soldiers), to escort salts to Kunming, waiting for Zhang Wuji and Ah Xiu there, before finally meeting Basalawarmi.

2. Sichuan (only the newly wedded couple): meet Ming Yuzhen.

3. Go some place else (while outside Xiangyang, for honeymoon purpose)

---

*Here's the historicl reference of Basalawarmi:*

Basalawarmi (Middle Mongolian: ᠪᠠᠵᠠᠯᠠᠸᠠᠷᠮᠠᠢ, Chinese: 把匝剌瓦爾密, died January 6, 1382), commonly known by his hereditary noble title, the Prince of Liang, was a Yuan dynasty prince and loyalist who fought against the Ming dynasty. He was a descendant of Khökhechi, the fifth son of Kublai Khan. After the Ming took over Yunnan, the Hongwu Emperor exiled Basalawarmi's family to Korea.

**Bab 9: Persinggahan Di Xianyang**

Okay, let's make it a rather complete journey, filled with adventures and challenges, and of course intimacy for Zhang Wuji and Xiao Zhao (bt not too long). Tthe rest of the storyline would go this way:

- Short intercut with Ganzhou's side:
  + The report to Li Furen, highlighting Zhang Wuji's marriage, actually because Ah San's overheard Xiao Zhao calling him 'Xianggong', and then passed this rumor to (unexpectedly) Lu Xian, in Ganzhou. But fortunately, caught by Li Furen before the shocking news reached Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min, creating some rather hilarious irony.
  + Zhou Zhiruo's jealousy and suspicious nature (maybe overheard some rumors about Ah Xiu, and later Xiao Zhao)

- Continuing Zhang Wuji and Xiao Zhao's journey
  + Meet people sent by Miss Yang to help escort small groups to Kongtong Pai
  + Encounter several interesting new discoveries (implies historical context, related to the presence of Church of the East during Tang Dynasty)
  + Encounter Xuanming Er Lao (this time working for Li Siqi)
  + Discovery of a historical site on the way, a Buddhist's site, Western Xia's heritage
  + Discovery of wild wolfberry along the way (meaningful for the refugees)

- Short intercut with events in Xiangyang:
  + Fan Yao's team back from Fujian, along with yet another large group of refugees.
  + War between Zhu Yuanzhang and Chen Youliang in Lake Poyang

- Shortly back to the journey, the probably near Zhongxing, some refugees choose to settle some place there

- Back to Kaifeng, news about Chaghan Temur's death (6 July 1362)
  + Shock in the palace
  + Devastating in Ganzhou, heartbreaking, but could not leave
  + Shock in Xiangyang. Yidu is near!
  + Wang Baobao wants to take revenge.

- Zhang Wuji and Xiao Zhao is finally arrive in Zhongxing, and quickly change the name to Yinchuan, change the whole territory to Ningxia.

---

Okay, here are three Mongolian male names with meanings that could be considered somewhat humorous or evocative of strong, perhaps even "wild" characteristics, suitable for loyal Ming Jiao followers and friends of Elbeg:

1. Adilgaar: (Адлигаар) - This name means "Wild Horse" or "Untamed Horse." It evokes an image of freedom, speed, and perhaps a bit of unpredictable energy. For a loyal follower, it could symbolize their unbridled devotion and spirit.

2. Shiiregtei Chono: (Шиирэгтэй Чоно) - This translates to "Fierce Wolf" or "Wolf with Fangs." While wolves are often seen as fierce, the explicit "with fangs" can add a slightly exaggerated or even cartoonish level of intensity, making it somewhat humorous in that over-the-top way. For a believer, it could represent their unwavering and aggressive defense of their faith and leader.

3. Galzuut Bars: (Галзуут Барс) - Meaning "Mad Tiger" or "Frenzied Tiger." This name combines the power of a tiger with the slightly unhinged quality of "mad" or "frenzied." It suggests someone who is fiercely loyal and perhaps a bit overzealous in their devotion, potentially leading to comical situations.

---

Now the timeline is entering winter, and we have to foreshadow the highlight of Yuan Dynasty in 1361, which is quite short:

- 1361, Red Turban Rebellion: Yuan forces in southwest Shandong surrender to rebel forces.

Meanwhile, the rough approx. of 3-4 days from local people in Xumishan does not applied in winter. The journey will be tough, and actually is not recommended to take so many people to the north.

Since Fan Yao and the three of Elbeg's men are here, they can be a big help.

The most well-known ancient pagoda in Ningxia is the Chengtian Temple Pagoda in Yinchuan. Also known as the Chengtiansi Pagoda, it is a historic Buddhist pagoda with intricate carvings and ornate details. It is an 11-story octagonal structure with wooden floors and was built in 1050 to bless the young King Li Liangzuo. 

The pagoda is hollow, with an entrance on the east side and wooden stairs leading to the top, where windows offer a view of the city. Inside, visitors can see ancient Buddhist relics. The pagoda is a key cultural relic protection unit in China and a popular tourist destination. 

Another notable pagoda in Ningxia is the Haibao Pagoda in Yinchuan, which is considered the oldest Buddhist architecture in the province. It is also a key cultural relic protection unit.
