# Shaolin, 1355

## The True Nature of Madame Song

That night, the heroes celebrated, drinking until dawn. They only rested when they were truly drunk and could neither drink nor eat any more. As noon approached, one by one they bid farewell to Kongwen and Kongzhi Dashi to leave the Shaolin Monastery. Zhang Wuji observed the Emei disciples, lost like sheep without a shepherd, and his heart ached. He also looked at Song Qingshu, lying helpless on the stretcher, unclear whether he was dead or alive. Thus, he approached them and asked Jing Hui, "Allow me to examine Song Dage's wounds."

With a cold tone, Jinghui replied, "A cat mourning the death of a rat. There’s no need for you to shed crocodile tears."

Nearby, Zhou Dian could not hold back and scoffed, "For the sake of the past good relations with your leader, Jiaozhu is willing to examine this man surnamed Song's injuries. In truth, everyone has the right to kill this traitorous disciple. What more can a cruel nun like you say?"

Jinghui wanted to retort, but upon seeing Zhou Dian's coarse and ugly face, she felt intimidated; this person could act irrationally. If a fight broke out, she would be at a disadvantage, so she restrained her anger and laughed coldly, saying, "For generations, our Emei leaders have always been 'as clear as ice and as pure as jade,' a pure maiden. If Zhou Zhangmen does not uphold his morals and purity, how could he possibly become our sect's Zhangmen? Hmph! If a traitor like Song Qingshu remains in our sect, he will tarnish Zhou Zhangmen's reputation. Li Shizhi, Long Shizhi, please take this person back to Wudang Sect!"

The two Emei disciples carrying Song Qingshu obeyed her command. They lifted the stretcher and brought it to Yu Lianzhou, placing it before him before returning to their own group. Everyone was shocked.

"What... what is this?" Yu Lianzhou asked. "Isn't this the husband of your leader?"

"Hmph!" Jinghui snorted with disdain. "How could Zhangmen possibly regard a man like this? He is exceedingly angry with that scrawny brat, Zhang Wuji, who broke his promise and fled from the marriage, humiliating our sect before all the heroes of the martial world. It was at that moment that Zhangmen persuaded this man to come and pretend to be his husband. Who knew... hm, hm, if we had known, why should our leader suffer such misfortune? Now, he... he..."

Zhang Wuji had been listening from the side with a flat expression. He could no longer restrain himself and stepped forward to ask, "You said earlier, Song Furen... she... she is actually *not* Song Furen?"

Jinghui turned away and said with bitterness, "I'm not speaking to you."

At that moment, Song Qingshu, still lying on the stretcher, stirred and lamented, "Is... is Zhang Wuji dead?"

"In your dreams!" Jinghui huffed. "You’re dying, and you’re still thinking about pretty faces."

Seeing Jinghui so emotional and her ramblings completely nonsensical, Yin Liting quietly asked Bei Jinyi, one of the other Emei disciples, "Bei Shimei, what is really going on?"

Bei Jinyi was a close friend of Ji Xiaofu. Hearing Yin Liting’s question, she hesitated for a while before saying, "Jinghui Shijie, Yin Liuxia is not an outsider. Let Xiaomei explain, shall we?"

"What do you mean by outsider or insider?" Jinghui retorted. "If she is *not* an outsider, we should explain. If she is an outsider, then we *must* explain even more. Our Zhou Zhangmen is clean and pure, and has nothing to do with this cunning bastard surnamed Song. You have all seen for yourselves [Shou Gong Sha](#bookmark=id.322i65tocilt) on Zhangmen's arm. We should indeed spread this fact to all in the martial world, so that the purity of Emei Pai is not tarnished..."

Yin Liting thought, "Jinghui Shitai is somewhat deranged; her ramblings are confusing." Thus, he continued to inquire further of Bei Jinyi, "Bei Shimei, if that is the case, could you explain it more clearly? How did our nephew join your Emei Pai? What is the connection between your esteemed leader and him? One day, I must report this to our Shifu. This matter involves both our sects, and I think it's better if we can maintain a good relationship between the two sects, right?"

Bei Jinyi sighed and said, "When it comes to martial arts and behavior, this Song Shaoxia is actually quite talented and rare in the martial world. Only, due to the foolish whims of youth, he has ultimately fallen into this sin. It seems that our Zhangmen promised that as soon as Zhang Wuji died, and erased the disgrace that humiliated him during that previous wedding, then Zhangmen would marry him. That is why he was willing to join our sect and learn martial arts from Zhangmen. During the recent gathering of heroes, Zhangmen suddenly announced herself as Song Furen — the wife of this Song Shaoxia. At that moment, we were all very shocked. On that day, Zhangmen’s achievements stunned the heroes present by defeating all the other sects..."

Zhou Dian interrupted, "That was because Jiaozhu intentionally lost! Your fart stinks so much!"

Bei Jinyi ignored his comment and continued, "Although the disciples of our sect were very proud, that night we still questioned where that name 'Song Furen', those three characters, came from? Zhangmen showed her arm and firmly said, 'You all see for yourselves!' We all saw [Shou Gong Sha](#bookmark=id.322i65tocilt) glowing bright red on Zhangmen's arm, so we knew that she remained a virgin. Zhangmen then said, 'At present, I call myself Song Furen because it is indeed necessary. I want to make that scrawny brat Zhang Wuji angry, disturb his thoughts, so I can win. That scrawny brat's kungfu is simply too extraordinary, I am definitely no match for him. For the sake of our sect’s reputation, why should I care about my own reputation?' She said all this firmly and confidently, loudly, so that everyone would hear it. She also said, 'Disciples in this sect, whether male or female, unless one is indeed a Monk or Nun, have never been forbidden to marry. However, considering our sect founder, Guo Zushi, all the highest and deepest arts will only be passed down to those disciples who maintain their purity. Every time a new female disciple bends and vows to become an Emei disciple, the Shifu will always implant the Shou Gong Sha. Every year, on the day of Guo Zushi's birth, Xianshi will conduct inspections. That year, Ji Shijie... that..." Speaking up to this point, she choked, then stopped speaking entirely.

Even so, Yin Liting and the others understood what she meant. Bei Jinyi wanted to say that when Ji Xiaofu's purity was violated by Yang Xiao, the [Shou Gong Sha](#bookmark=id.322i65tocilt) on her arm disappeared, and that was when Miejue Shitai became aware of the problem. Yin Liting was currently leading a very happy married life with Yang Buhui, but when he remembered Ji Xiaofu, he couldn’t suppress his sorrow. He unconsciously glanced at Yang Xiao and saw his eyes glistening with tears, causing him to turn his face away.

"Yin Liuxia," Bei Jinyi said. "Our Zhangmen intentionally wants to anger the Ming Jiao leader, Zhang Wuji. Intentionally, she used Song Shaoxia, who is infatuated with her. But in the end, this caused another problem. I hope Song Shaoxia can recover as soon as possible, and also that Yin Liuxia can speak kindly with Zhang Zhenren and Song Daxia, so that both of our sects can avoid conflict."

Yin Liting nodded. "So that is the matter. My nephew is indeed rebellious, and he openly defied his superior; his death would not be mourned. He truly embarrassed our sect. I only hope he can die cleanly as soon as possible." Yin Liting was naturally soft-hearted, but remembering Song Qingshu's actions that led to Mo Shenggu's death deeply affected him.

As they were speaking, suddenly a chilling scream pierced the air from a distance. It sounded like Zhou Zhiruo; the voice was heart-rending and filled with fear, as if she was encountering something very dangerous and terrifying. Everyone was astonished, especially since this occurred during the day when the sun was shining bright, surrounded by many people. Nonetheless, the voice truly sent shivers down their spines, as though the person had seen an apparition right before their eyes. As if hearing a command, they all turned toward the source of the sound simultaneously.

Zhang Wuji, Jing Hui, Bei Jinyi, and the others rushed forward. Zhang Wuji was worried that Zhou Zhiruo might be facing a dangerous opponent, so he ran with all his strength. After jumping a few times, he entered the forest. He saw a dark green shadow frantically running toward him; it was none other than Zhou Zhiruo. Desperately, Zhang Wuji approached her and asked, "Zhiruo, what is happening?"

Zhou Zhiruo screamed with a terrified face, "A ghost, a ghost! There’s a ghost chasing me!" She threw herself against Zhang Wuji's chest, trembling uncontrollably.

Seeing her so frightened, as if she had lost her soul, Zhang Wuji lightly patted her shoulder. "Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, there’s no ghost," he comforted. "What did you see?" He noticed Zhou Zhiruo’s clothing was tattered from running through wild rose bushes, and her face was splattered with blood. Half of the sleeve of her robe was torn, revealing her smooth white arm, akin to the color of a lotus root. Clearly visible was a bright red spot there, as red as coral or red jade, that was the Shou Gongsha.

Zhang Wuji, who understood medicine well, knew that once the Shou Gongsha was implanted there, the mark would remain forever, unless the woman married or lost her virginity. When he heard Jinghui and Bei Jinyi's explanations earlier, he was only half convinced. Now that he saw it with his own eyes, the remnants of doubt completely vanished from his mind.

At that moment, a myriad of thoughts enveloped his mind. "So her marriage to Song Qingshu was just a pretense. Why did she want to deceive me? Why did she deliberately want to anger me? Is it really because of the title of 'Number One Hero'? Or is she testing my heart, to see if I still have feelings for her?" Then in a flash, he recalled, "Ah, Zhang Wuji, this Miss Zhou is the enemy who killed your cousin. Whether she is still a virgin or has married someone else, what does it matter to you?" But seeing how terrified Zhou Zhiruo was now, he couldn't bear to dismiss her.

Zhou Zhiruo hid her face in Zhang Wuji’s chest. She realized how broad and sturdy his body was and also smelled his masculine scent, gradually her fear began to dissipate. "Wuji Gege," she said. "Is it really you?"

"Yes, it’s me," Zhang Wuji replied. "What did you see? Why were you so terrified?"

Zhou Zhiruo was soon engulfed in fear again. Her cries erupted as she sobbed uncontrollably on Zhang Wuji’s shoulder, tears streaming down her cheeks.

At that moment, Yang Xiao, Wei Yixiao, Jing Hui, Yin Liting, and the others arrived one by one at the scene. Upon seeing this spectacle, they exchanged glances and quickly left to allow the two some privacy. Ming Jiao, Wudang Pai, and Emei Pai still hoped Zhou Zhiruo and Zhang Wuji would reconcile and eventually unite through marriage. It must be acknowledged, it was very difficult for all of them to forget the humiliation caused by Zhao Min earlier. Moreover, Zhao Min was a Mongolian woman; if Zhang Wuji married her, they feared it would create problems for their great mission.

After crying for a moment, Zhou Zhiruo finally said, "Wuji Gege, is there someone chasing me?"

"There is no one," Zhang Wuji replied. "Who would chase you? Could it be Xuanming Er'lao?"

"No, not them!" Zhou Zhiruo said. "Have you checked thoroughly? Are you sure there’s no one... no, it’s *not* a person... Are you certain there’s not *something*, anything, chasing me?"

Zhang Wuji smiled and said, "The sun is shining so brightly, I can see everything clearly." His voice softened. "Zhiruo," he said again. "You've expended too much energy these past few days; you must be very tired. Perhaps you imagined something and thought you saw it."

"Impossible! Impossible!" Zhou Zhiruo insisted. "I saw it three times — *three times in a row*." Her voice trembled, clearly, she was very frightened.

"What did you see three times?" Zhang Wuji asked.

With one hand resting on Zhang Wuji's shoulder, Zhou Zhiruo tried to stand despite her trembling legs. Gathering all her remaining courage, she turned to look behind her. In an instant, she turned back, staring at Zhang Wuji, looking at his gentle and patient expression, full of concern. Her heart ached. Suddenly, she felt very exhausted and collapsed to the ground.

"Wuji Gege," she said. "I... I deceived you. I was the one who took the Yitian Sword and the Dragon-slaying Sabre; I was the one who killed... killed Miss Yin... I was the one who stunned Xie Daxia. I... I did not marry Song Qingshu. In my heart, I only have... only have you."

Zhang Wuji sighed. "Actually, I already knew all of this. But... but *why* did you do all this?" 

Crying, Zhou Zhiruo said, "You don’t know what my master said at Wan'an Temple. She told me the secret of the Yitian Sword and the Dragon-slaying Sabre. She wanted me to seize both treasures by any means possible, to bring honor to Emei Pai. She ordered me to vow to pretend to like you, but she did not allow me to love you..."

Zhang Wuji gently patted her hand, recalling how Miejue Shitai had killed Ji Xiaofu with her palm, how amidst the heat of the desert, Miejue Shitai had sworn to destroy Ming Jiao, how he had witnessed her ruthlessly eliminate numerous Ming Jiao members from the Golden Banner with the Yitian Sword in her hand. Then when sliding down from the top of Wan'an Temple, she would rather die than be rescued by her. All of this showed how deep Miejue Shitai’s hatred for Ming Jiao was. Since Zhou Zhiruo had been chosen as her successor and received her last mandate, everything brutal and cruel she did must have been tied to Miejue Shitai's instructions.

Naturally, Zhang Wuji was a very forgiving person. He never bore grudges against others. Furthermore, he recalled all the kindness Zhou Zhiruo had shown him when they were young, along the Han River, how she had cared for him through his severe illness from the strikes of Xuanming Er Lao. And also, when he faced the couple He Taichong and that short and tall duo from Huashan, had Zhou Zhiruo not secretly helped him, he might have already perished at their hands long ago. Above all, he remembered that despite her extremely cruel and cunning actions, all of those actions sprung from the deep feelings she held for him — Zhang Wuji.

At that moment, her beautiful and delicate body leaned against his chest; Zhang Wuji could not suppress the gentle feelings surging in his heart. "Zhiruo," he called softly. "What was it that you saw that terrified you so?"

Suddenly, Zhou Zhiruo jumped and said, "I won’t say. It must be a vengeful spirit returned to the world to haunt me. I have committed so many evils. I deserve to suffer. I have explained everything to you, I... I myself will not live long..."

She covered her face with both hands and ran down the mountain.

Zhang Wuji felt as though his mind was shrouded in thick fog. "What kind of ghost is tormenting her? Could it be those Kai Pang thugs seeking revenge, intentionally disguised as ghosts?" Slowly, he turned back toward the temple.

He saw Zhou Zhiruo heading towards the crowd of Emei disciples. Bei Jinyi took a cloak and wrapped it around her. Zhou Zhiruo whispered something, and the Emei disciples immediately bowed in unison.

By that time, most of the heroes present had left Shaolin. Kong Wen and Kong Zhi Dashi were busy receiving farewells. Yang Xiao, Fan Yao, and the others gathered around Zhang Wuji. "We should also leave," Zhang Wuji said.

He watched Zhou Zhiruo approach Kongwen Dashi and say something quietly. Kongwen's expression changed; he looked surprised. Then he shook his head. Whatever she had said, it seemed that Kongwen Dashi had rejected her request. Zhou Zhiruo spoke again, then she knelt before Kongwen. She clasped her hands respectfully and murmured something with a serious face, as if she were praying. Kongwen appeared grim, muttering prayers.

"Jiaozhu," said Zhou Dian. "You must stop her, do not let her do that."

"Do what?" asked Zhang Wuji.

"Miss Zhou wants to become a nun," replied Zhou Dian. "She will go towards the gates of emptiness. This is bad for Jiaozhu."

Yang Xiao chuckled and said, "Even if Miss Zhou intends to become a nun, she is still a woman. How can she expect a Shaolin monk to be her teacher?"

Zhou Dian slapped his forehead hard. "Ah, quite right! Quite right!" he exclaimed. "I was foolish! But what did Miss Zhou request? One is the head of Shaolin, the other is the head of Emei, their positions are equal; neither should kneel before the other."

They saw Zhou Zhiruo standing. Her face looked somewhat relieved and comforted. Zhang Wuji sighed and said, "We should not interfere with others' affairs." He turned his face and said, "Min Mei, let's go." But unexpectedly, when he turned, he did not see Zhao Min.

During these past few days, Zhao Min had not left his side; she was like a shadow following Zhang Wuji wherever he went. Zhang Wuji was a bit startled. "Where is Miss Zhao?" he asked, while cursing himself inwardly. "Damn it! I’m sure Min Mei saw me with Zhiruo leaning against my chest. Perhaps she thinks I can't forget my old love and considers me unreliable." Quickly, he instructed everyone to search for Zhao Min.

Xin Ran, the leader of the Fire Banner, reported, "Report, Jiaozhu, just now your subordinate saw Miss Zhao walking down the mountain alone."

Zhang Wuji felt sad. "Min Mei left everything behind for me," he thought. "How much suffering has she gone through? How could I bear to neglect her?" Thus, he turned to Yang Xiao and said, "Yang Bobo, I leave all affairs here to you; I must go immediately."

He bid farewell to Kongwen and Kongzhi Dashi, as well as to Yu Lianzhou, Zhang Songxi, Yin Liting, and all others still present. Finally, he said to Zhou Zhiruo, "Zhiruo, take care of yourself. We will meet again soon." Zhou Zhiruo lowered her head deeply; she did not reply, merely nodding slightly. A tear fell, wetting her cheek.

While gathering his qi to use his light body technique, Zhang Wuji descended the mountain rapidly. Along the way, numerous heroes were traveling back from Shaolin. He did not want to bid farewell to them all; hence, he merely passed them by without stopping, but he did not see Zhao Min at all along the journey. In an instant, he had chased over thirty _li_. The sky began to darken, and the number of people walking around appeared to thin. Suddenly, he remembered, "Min Mei is clever. If she is deliberately avoiding me, she will surely choose to avoid the main road. Otherwise, at my speed, I would have seen her by now. Could she still be hiding around the peak of Shaoshi? Deliberately waiting for me to leave before she herself emerges and leaves far behind?"

Fueled by anxiety, he forgot about hunger and thirst. Zhang Wuji ran back around the mountain peak and into the valley. Frequently he leaped into tall trees, climbed peaks or steep cliffs, looking in all directions. But the mountain was eerily silent; only the sounds of crows flying in the night could be heard. He circled around the back of the mountain peak but still did not see Zhao Min. "Whatever happens," he thought, "I will remain faithful to searching for you; even if I have to traverse the sea to the ends of the earth, I will certainly find you."

After deciding this, his mind began to calm down a bit. Gazing toward the northeast, he saw two large locust trees growing side by side, reaching up high into the clouds beside the mountain path. Jumping up into the trees, he found a horizontal branch and laid down on it. After enduring a long day of hardship and facing unexpected situations, he soon fell asleep shortly after lying down.

Approaching midnight, he was suddenly awakened by the sound of footsteps from several _zhang_ away, instantly making him alert. At that moment, the full moon had shifted westward. Under the moonlight, he saw a shadow gliding swiftly down the slope towards the south. The figure was slender with a small waist; it was clearly not a man; this shadow belonged to a woman.

Overjoyed, he nearly shouted and called out, "Min Mei!" But he then realized something was amiss. The figure was taller than Zhao Min, and her light body technique was very different from Zhao Min; though her speed was inferior to Zhou Zhiruo, her steps were lighter and appeared more lively. His curiosity was piqued. "This woman is out wandering alone in the middle of the night; what could she be doing?" he thought.

Initially, Zhang Wuji thought this was none of his business; why should he be concerned about what a woman he did not know intended to do? But a second later, he reflected, "Who knows? Maybe I will find Min Mei by asking this woman. Even if she knows nothing, I could leave peacefully anyway, and it wouldn’t matter. I shouldn’t miss any opportunity." Thus, he got up and quietly started following the woman.

Worried that the woman would sense she was being followed, he did not dare to get too close. Besides, stalking a woman, especially in the dead of night, he would find it troubling to explain the suspicions that might arise.

He saw the woman wearing dark clothing, and she was evidently heading toward the Shaolin Monastery. "Although she has nothing to do with Min Mei, it seems she is undertaking a covert operation related to the martial world," he thought. "If her intentions pose a threat to Shaolin, then I must intervene." He hesitated in his steps to listen, and finding no one else around, he could ensure that this woman had no followers.

After walking for the approximate amount of time it would take to finish a bowl of rice, the woman never once looked around. Zhang Wuji felt as if he knew this woman well, but at that moment he could not remember clearly where he had met her. "Could it be Wu Qingying? Or one of Emei Pai's disciples?"

A few _li_ later, the Shaolin Monastery came into view. The woman turned toward the hillside, approaching the monastery from the side. Suddenly, she slowed her pace and crept delicately among the trees and between the large stones, clearly worried about being seen.

Suddenly, he heard the sound of bells ringing from the direction of the main hall of Shaolin, followed by the sound of people reciting prayers. Zhang Wuji was greatly puzzled. "Do the Shaolin monks still recite their prayers at midnight? It seems there are hundreds of them. Could there be an important religious ceremony taking place right now?"

The woman in front continued with more assurance, reaching the side of the main hall a few _zhang_ later. Suddenly there were the sounds of light footsteps. The woman quickly ducked into the thick grass. Four Shaolin monks armed with sabers and staffs were patrolling around the temple. The woman waited until the four monks had passed, before she sprang up and leapt toward the entrance of the main hall. Her leap was as light as cotton drifting in mid-air. Her light body technique certainly ranked as excellent in the martial world. Zhang Wuji saw that the woman did not carry any weapon at all, and she was alone; thus, he concluded that her arrival at Shaolin was not intended to create trouble. He wanted to know who this woman truly was, whether she was an enemy or a friend. Therefore, he crouched behind her and moved toward the northwest of the main hall.

He realized that his position was not advantageous at all. A person with rank like him sneakily lurking around Shaolin in the middle of the night—if any monk were to discover his presence, though they might excuse him, it would ruin his reputation. So he became more cautious; every step he took was as light as a cat stalking its prey.

At that moment, the sounds of prayer in the hall grew louder. Peeking through the cracks of a window, he could see hundreds of monks seated neatly in rows. They were all sitting on meditation mats, wearing yellow robes, wrapped in red kasayas. Some held prayer books used as guides for the ceremony, while the majority clasped their hands and bowed their heads, reciting prayers loudly. It sounded like they were praying for the souls of those who had passed. Suddenly, Zhang Wuji understood. "In the recent gathering of heroes, many people died here. In facing the assault of the Yuan army, even more people perished. Therefore, they are holding this special ceremony for those who died."

He saw Kong Wen Dashi standing in front of the offering table. A young girl was standing beside him. As soon as he saw her, Zhang Wuji was shocked, for the girl was none other than Zhou Zhiruo. Although he could not see her face from there, he could tell that her expression was filled with sadness and suffering; her beautiful eyebrows were probably furrowed, as if she was bearing a million troubles.

"This must be the reason," Zhang Wuji thought. "It turns out she was kneeling before Kongwen Dashi to ask him to hold this ceremony. I guess she has now realized all her mistakes and wants to repent. So many lives have been lost due to death’s claw and her blade."

He then tried to focus his gaze to read the inscription on the memorial plaque atop the table. He was greatly shocked after reading the inscription, which turned out to be, ['Nu Xia Yin Li Zhi Ling Wei'](#bookmark=id.9co4iw9x6efv), seven characters. Zhang Wuji felt his heart was sore, almost as if it was being sliced. He recalled that in his short life, his cousin had loved him so deeply and sincerely. He could not hold back the tears.

Amidst the sounds of prayers and the chanting of the monks, Zhou Zhiruo sincerely knelt and bowed deeply, while her lips murmured prayers. Zhang Wuji exerted all his strength, trying to listen closely to what she was saying: "Miss Yin... your soul in heaven... rest in peace and tranquility… do not come again to disturb me..."

Zhang Wuji gripped the wall where he was leaning, a multitude of thoughts swirling in his mind. "Biaomei was killed by her hands; it is clear this is cruel and vicious, but the torment Zhiruo is enduring now is immense, certainly not any lighter than the physical torment Biaomei suffered." Suddenly, within his sea of thoughts emerged a verse often recited by members of Ming Jiao, which he had heard often at Guangming Ding, "What joy there is in life? What pain in death? I pity mankind with the suffering they endure!"

Slowly, Zhou Zhiruo stood up, her body facing somewhat eastward. Suddenly her expression changed drastically, and she screamed in terror, "You... you... you're back again!" Her voice trembled, drowning out all other sounds in that room.

Zhang Wuji followed her gaze and saw that the paper covering the window seemed to be torn. From behind that hole appeared the face of a young woman. Her face was full of scars. Zhang Wuji was so startled that he could not suppress his own scream. Though her face was full of scars and the swellings that had previously been there had disappeared, he could clearly see that it was the face of Yin Li, his deceased cousin.

He wanted to rush forward to call her, but his legs would not cooperate, as if his feet were glued to the ground.

The moment her face appeared through the window, a loud thud echoed in the main hall, and Zhou Zhiruo fainted, collapsing to the floor. Zhang Wuji no longer cared about what the Shaolin monks might think; he hurriedly rushed out and cried, "Zhu'er! Is that you?" But there was no reply.

After calming himself, he slid around the back of the building to chase after her, but all he could see was the moonlight hanging high above the clouds, casting its shadow on the trees. The girl in black was nowhere to be seen. Normally, he did not believe in ghosts, fairies, or any supernatural beings in this world. But now, faced with such a scene, he could not help but feel cold sweat trickling down his back, all the hair on his body standing on end. Hugging himself, he then thought, "That must be her! It must be her! No wonder I recognized her back; it was Zhu'er. Could it be that her soul knew the Shaolin monks were chanting prayers for her passage to the other side? So she deliberately came to receive those prayers? Is it possible because she died tragically, her spirit now wanders?"

As the Shaolin monks heard the noise, a few immediately appeared to investigate its origin. Upon seeing Zhang Wuji, they were taken aback and asked, "We had no idea Zhang Jiaozhu was visiting us in the middle of the night. Forgive us for not properly welcoming your arrival."

"I wouldn't dare," Zhang Wuji replied, clasping his hands together. He stepped into the hall.

There, he saw Zhou Zhiruo’s eyes still tightly shut. Her face was so pale, it looked like it contained no blood at all. It was evident she had not yet regained consciousness. He approached her and rubbed her back. Gradually, Zhou Zhiruo began to awaken.

As soon as she saw Zhang Wuji and realized she was in his embrace, Zhou Zhiruo tightened her grip and screamed, "A ghost, a ghost!"

Zhang Wuji said, "This is indeed peculiar, but you need not be afraid. There are so many monks here; I am sure they will uncover the mystery."

Zhou Zhiruo had always been very self-assured and calm. This time she was genuinely terrified and had lost all her confidence. At that moment, she was publicly embracing Zhang Wuji, and upon hearing him speak, her face flushed red and she was shy, quickly pulling back and distancing herself. She stood but could not stop trembling. Quickly, she reached for Zhang Wuji's hand, and despite knowing she was about to die, she didn’t want to let go of that hand.

Zhang Wuji exchanged glances with Kong Wen Dashi and mentioned that someone had been eavesdropping on them earlier. No monk had seen that person, but it was clear that tangible evidence remained: the paper covering the window had indeed been torn, and the hole it left was still present.

"Wuji Ge... Zhang Jiaozhu," Zhou Zhiruo said. "That was what I saw earlier."

Zhang Wuji nodded.

"You... you..." Zhou Zhiruo's voice trembled. "Who did you see earlier?"

"My cousin — Yin Li," Zhang Wuji replied. Zhou Zhiruo screamed in horror and fainted again.

This time, Zhang Wuji caught her, and she did not fall to the ground. She fainted briefly, but regained consciousness more quickly this time. Zhang Wuji said, "I did see Biaomei, but... but she is a human, *not* a ghost."

"She is *not* a ghost?" Zhou Zhiruo insisted, her voice still trembling.

Zhang Wuji said, "I followed her along the road to Shaolin. She walked just like a human, not like a ghost." He said this to comfort Zhou Zhiruo, but in his heart, he was actually doubtful.

"So you saw her walk, like a human — like us? Not like a ghost?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

Zhang Wuji described how he had seen a woman in black and followed her along the road to Shaolin, and how he saw the woman hiding outside the window, peeking into the main hall. Every one of her actions and movements showed that she was a young girl skilled in martial arts, with nothing strange about her at all.

"Fangzhang," he asked Kong Wen. "Zaixia has one important question, not sure if my understanding is correct. I seek guidance from Fangzhang. If someone dies, does she truly become a ghost?"

Kongwen contemplated for a moment before answering. "The matter of life after death, and what the afterlife actually is, is not something easy to comprehend."

Zhang Wuji said, "In that case, why did Fangzhang hold a ceremony to send the souls of the deceased across?"

"[Shanzai, shanzai!](#bookmark=id.k8faw1wyf76k)" Kongwen said. "The ghosts of the deceased, in the understanding of this mere mortal, do not need to be sent or helped to reach the afterlife. In matters of life and death, the goodness of a person leads to rewards, and evil leads to commensurate punishment. The teaching of Buddhism is to help the living achieve peace; those who need help crossing are those still alive in this world."

Zhang Wuji understood immediately. Joining his hands together, he said, "Thank you very much for Fangzhang's guidance. I have disturbed the tranquility of the temple in the middle of the night. I can only hope for forgiveness from Fangzhang."

Kongwen smiled and said, "Jiaozhu is a great benefactor to our temple. You have helped us multiple times, sparing us from catastrophe; why should we engage in so much politeness?"

Zhang Wuji quickly exited the crowd of monks. He approached Zhou Zhiruo and said, "Let’s go."

Zhou Zhiruo appeared reluctant; she was afraid to leave the safe, Buddha-like atmosphere of the building. Zhang Wuji felt uneasy pressuring her, so he merely clasped his hands once more. "If so, we part here." Finishing his speech, he turned toward the gate.

As he gazed at his back, suddenly Zhou Zhiruo called out, "Wuji Gege, will you visit me again? Let me... let me accompany you." She jumped forward to catch up to him, and then they walked side by side, exiting the temple.

After they had distanced themselves from the monastery, Zhou Zhiruo leaned against Zhang Wuji's shoulder and grasped his hand. Zhang Wuji knew she was still scared. Feeling her soft and delicate hand grasping his, and scenting the unique aroma of a woman from her body, it was difficult for him not to be moved.

The two walked in silence for a while. Zhou Zhiruo slowly inhaled deeply and said, "Wuji Gege, when we first met at the Han River, I was saved by Zhang Zhenren. Had I known I would suffer like this later, I wish I had died at the Han River back then."

Zhang Wuji did not respond; in his heart, he recalled the verse often recited by the followers of Ming Jiao, and involuntarily began quoting it, "What joy there is in life? What pain in death? I pity mankind, seeing all their sufferings."

Hearing the quotation, the hand that Zhou Zhiruo held tightly in his suddenly trembled. In a low voice, she said, "Zhang Zhenren took me to Emei Pai. He surely had good intentions. But if only he had been willing to take me as his disciple at Wudang Shan, things might have turned out differently. Ah... I don't mean to say that [Enshi](#bookmark=id.copssibr6goy) did not treat me well, but... but he forced me to harm you, while in my heart... frankly speaking..." 

Zhang Wuji was somewhat touched by the sincerity in her voice. He understood that Zhou Zhiruo truly had many difficulties, and that much of her cruel actions resulted from her greatly valuing Miejue Shitai's last words. Seeing her in this state of fear deepened his feelings for Zhou Zhiruo even more than before.

The gentle night breeze blowing along the mountain path carried the aromas of wildflowers growing around them. It was the beginning of summer, and the night was exceptionally clear and cloudless. Aware of the presence of a beautiful young girl pouring her heart out to him, and standing so close at his side, Zhang Wuji could not contain the stirring within his chest. Moreover, recalling how he had helped her remove the poison back on Snake Island, their skins had touched so closely and intimately. He had amassed a myriad of kindness in the past, and they had been engaged. All of this caused him to be tossed between feelings of confusion, not knowing what to do.

"Wuji Gege," Zhou Zhiruo continued, "back in Hangzhou, when we were about to get married, why did you follow after Miss Zhao as soon as she invited you? Inside your heart, did you truly love her?"

"I was just about to tell you what happened then," Zhang Wuji said. "Why don’t we sit by here for a moment?" He pointed to a large stone by the roadside.

"No," Zhou Zhiruo said. "At this moment, my heart is very tumultuous, I can’t sit and listen to you talk. Let's walk without talking, and then we can talk again later."

Zhang Wuji nodded. He followed Zhou Zhiruo as she walked aimlessly, seemingly without any clear direction or goal. She led Zhang Wuji down a small path and walked about four to five _li_ before finally saying, "Alright, now you can talk." She walked towards a large stone in front of a dense bush. They sat side by side there.

From there, Zhang Wuji began to recount how what Zhao Min held at that time was a clump of Xie Xun's hair, which left him with no choice but to follow her, and everything else that happened afterward. Zhou Zhiruo listened intently from the beginning to the end. After that, she became quiet for a while, saying nothing.

"Zhiruo, do you blame me?" Zhang Wuji asked.

Zhou Zhiruo choked up slightly, then said, "I have made so many mistakes; I can only blame myself, why should I blame you?"

Zhang Wuji gently patted her shoulder and softly said, "In this world, all mistakes arise out of situations. The things we face in the future are difficult to predict. You shouldn’t be too hard on yourself or lose heart."

"Wuji Gege," Zhou Zhiruo said, lifting her head to gaze at him, "I have a question that I have always wanted to ask you. I ask that you answer me truthfully, you must not hide anything from me."

"Alright," Zhang Wuji said. "I will not hide anything from you."

Zhou Zhiruo said, "I know there are at least four women in this world who love you wholeheartedly. The first is Xiao Zhao, who has gone far to Persia. The other is Miss Zhao, and the last one... she..." She wanted to say 'Miss Yin', but did not have the courage to mention it. After some time, she continued, "If all four of us were alive and well, and we were all by your side, which one would you truly love?"

Zhang Wuji felt confusion bubbling up like a spring from within his heart. "This... hmm... on this matter..." He stammered.

Since the time they had drifted aimlessly in that ocean, together with Zhou Zhiruo, Zhao Min, Yin Li, and Xiao Zhao, it had often become clear in his mind. "These four women all sincerely love me, but what should I do? Regardless of who I choose as my wife, I will definitely hurt the hearts of the other three. But ultimately, deep in my heart, who do I truly love among them?"

Because he often found it difficult to make decisions, he had always told himself to forget about such matters. Sometimes he thought, "The Tartars have yet to be driven from this land; how can I establish a family? Ultimately, for what reason should I have children?"

At other times, he thought, "I am the Jiaozhu of Ming Jiao. Whatever order I give will be followed. I am responsible for the progress and decline not only of our sect but also in the martial world. I am sure in my life, I have never done anything disgraceful. But if I become lost in the charms of women now, then I will disgrace myself before the heroes of the martial world, and it will also tarnish the reputation of Ming Jiao."

Further, sometimes he thought, "Before dying, my mother earnestly warned me to be cautious of women, especially beautiful women, as they are adept at deceiving people. How could I forget my own mother’s advice?"

In fact, no matter how he argued, he was merely lying to himself. Deciding which woman he truly loved had nothing to do with Ming Jiao, it also would not disrupt his struggle to reclaim his country. It also would not disgrace the reputation of Ming Jiao. He simply always thought, "This one is very good, that one is also good," and thus he did not dare to dwell too deeply on them. Though he may have high martial skills, in day-to-day life, he was quite indecisive, making it hard to take definitive stands. Observing the course of his life, he had always preferred that everything happened naturally. When pressed to decide, he would rather sacrifice his own interests than disagree with the opinions or hopes of others. For example, in the matter of Qian Kun Da Nuo Yi, he learned it because of Xiao Zhao's encouragement. In terms of rights and positions, he had enough ability to take leadership of Ming Jiao, but he needed pushes from Yin Tianzheng, Yin Yewang, and others, so that he ultimately agreed to their suggestions. His engagement to Zhou Zhiruo stemmed from how he valued Xie Xun's request. He then did not bow to Heaven and Earth alongside Zhou Zhiruo to finalize their marriage because Zhao Min requested him not to. At that time, had it not been for Jin Hua Popo and Yin Li forcing matters, and preferably persuading him, he likely would have gladly followed them to Snake Island.

But sometimes he also involuntarily thought, "If only I could spend the rest of my life with those four of them, living together harmoniously and peacefully; how beautiful that would be!" After all, at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, be it a scholar, a merchant, a martial hero, or a rogue, it was not unusual for men to have more than one wife. It was just that Ming Jiao, originating from Persia, developed amidst political strife and always faced challenges and was considered a heretical teaching; therefore, for them, marital life felt incredibly impractical. The members of Ming Jiao always felt that at any given moment, their lives could end at the edge of a sword—hence, marrying a woman would become an additional burden.

Zhang Wuji naturally had a gentle and soft nature. In his mind, there was always the notion that whatever woman married him would be a tremendous fortune for him. If he took on more than one wife, then it would be unfair to the others. As a result, whenever this thought arose in his mind, he would suppress it. Whenever thoughts regarding this emerged, he would tell himself, "People should be content with what they have," but he always thought like this. "How shameful!"

Then Xiao Zhao went far to Persia, Yin Li died, and it appeared Zhao Min was the one who killed her. According to logic, it seemed his choices were now limited to Zhou Zhiruo alone. Yet, after going through a very long and complicated twist, strange things occurred, and the truth unraveled. Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min ultimately traded places. Those once regarded as wicked became good, and the reverse was also true. Additionally, the fact that Zhao Min severed ties with her own family had become widely known. Thus, he should have no difficulty deciding; was it not so? But unexpectedly, Zhao Min suddenly vanished without a trace, even without saying anything to him, and at that time, Zhou Zhiruo was there, cornering him with a wealth of questions.

Seeing him hesitate and not answer, Zhou Zhiruo said, "My questions are certainly frivolous, just *if*. Xiao Zhao has now become the leader of Ming Jiao Persia, who must remain a virgin. I... I have killed Miss Yin. So from the four of us, your choice now is only Miss Zhao. I just want to know, if we all four were alive and well, and we were all by your side, then what would *you* do?"

"Zhiruo," Zhang Wuji finally said. "This matter has long burdened my thoughts and heart. It’s clear; I find it very difficult to choose. Until today... I now know who I truly love."

"Who?" asked Zhou Zhiruo. "Is it... is it Miss Zhao?"

"Indeed," Zhang Wuji replied. "Today, as I searched for her with all my might and could not find her, I wished I could just die. If from this day forth, I can no longer meet Miss Zhao, I truly wish I could die. That is my deepest feeling, one I have never mentioned to anyone." At first, those four girls — Yin Li, Zhou Zhiruo, Xiao Zhao, and Zhao Min — were all the same in Zhang Wuji's eyes. But the moment Zhao Min left him today, he suddenly realized where her true place lay in the depths of his heart. She was different from the rest.

When Zhou Zhiruo heard his words, she silently thought, "That day in Dadu, I saw you go to a small tavern to meet her. I have always known how you feel in your heart. This was nothing but my empty dream; I originally hoped that if you and I married, perhaps... perhaps I could draw you back to love me. But it seems this... truly... I know it is impossible."

Zhang Wuji said regretfully, "Zhiruo, I will always have respect for you. Regarding Yin Biaomei, my heart will always be grateful. To Xiao Zhao, I will always have a tender place for her in my heart. But regarding Miss Zhao, truthfully... I actually have a love that seems carved in my heart and inscribed in my bones."

"Carved in my heart and inscribed in my bones," Zhou Zhiruo repeated. After a moment of silence, she said quietly, "Wuji Gege... my love for you is also carved in my heart and inscribed in my bones. Do... do you know that?"

Zhang Wuji was deeply moved. He touched Zhou Zhiruo's hand and softly said, "Zhiruo, I know. What I do not know is how I can repay such colossal love throughout my life. I... I truly feel guilty."

"You are not guilty. You have always been kind to me; do you think I do not know that?" said Zhou Zhiruo. "Let me ask again, if this time Miss Zhao leaves you and doesn’t return, you will not see her again. If she were killed by someone evil, or if she changed her mind and no longer loves you, what will you do?"

Zhang Wuji's heart had long been anxious thinking of Zhao Min. When he heard her words, he could no longer hold on. Like a dam that breaks, with a hoarse voice, he said, "I... I truly do not know! Whatever happens, even if I must go to heaven or to the underworld, I must find her."

Zhou Zhiruo sighed and said, "Her heart will not change. If you truly want to find her, it is actually not difficult."

Zhang Wuji was taken aback and delighted at once. "Where is she?" He stood up and repeated, "Zhiruo, quickly tell me where she is?"

Zhou Zhiruo's beautiful eyes stared intently at Zhang Wuji. Seeing his face filled with wild joy, she said gently, "You never showed emotions like this toward me. If you want to find Miss Zhao, you must promise to do one thing for me. Otherwise, you can forget her forever."

"What do you wish me to do?" Zhang Wuji asked.

"I haven't thought of it yet," Zhou Zhiruo said. "Later, when I have thought of it, I will tell you. I can promise this is nothing unethical or immoral; it will also not interfere with your goal to reclaim our country, and it will not ruin the good name or reputation of Ming Jiao. It’s just that this must not be easy to do."

Zhang Wuji's expression turned flat. He thought, "Min Mei also asked me to do three things, and she also said things like this. And so far, I have only done two things for her, and those two things were not easy to achieve. Why is Zhiruo mimicking her words now?"

"You want to do it or not; that is entirely up to you," Zhou Zhiruo said. "But a real man must keep his promises. If you promise, then you must not go back on it later."

Zhang Wuji hesitantly said, "You mentioned it wouldn’t violate morals and ethics, and it wouldn’t interfere in the matter of reclaiming our country and would not tarnish the good name of Ming Jiao?"

"Correct," Zhou Zhiruo responded.

"Very well," Zhang Wuji said. "If it indeed doesn’t violate morals and ethics and does not interfere with state affairs and does not tarnish the reputation of Ming Jiao, then I can promise."

"Ah, then let’s formalize our agreement now," Zhou Zhiruo said while extending her hand, ready to clap hands with Zhang Wuji.

Zhang Wuji understood that once he clapped hands, he was binding himself in heavy shackles. On the surface, Miss Zhou seemed very gentle, polite, and soft, but inside, her thoughts were crafty and her actions cruel. She was not at all inferior to Zhao Min. Thus, he raised his palm but did not immediately clap Zhou Zhiruo’s hand.

Zhou Zhiruo smiled and said, "As soon as you promise, I will tell you, and you will certainly meet your beloved then."

Zhang Wuji's chest felt aflame. He no longer cared about other matters, and directly clapped Zhou Zhiruo’s hand three times.

Zhou Zhiruo laughed and said, "Look, who is over there?" She reached for the bush behind her and pushed aside the leaves. There, behind the lush foliage, sat a young girl whose face appeared to be smiling, but she was not really smiling; who else could it be but Zhao Min.

Startled and thrilled, Zhang Wuji called out to her, "Min Mei!"

"Ah!" Suddenly, a few _zhang_ behind him, he heard another woman's voice, as if she could not contain her shock upon seeing Zhao Min appear. The voice was very soft, yet Zhang Wuji could hear it clearly.

Zhang Wuji stood there, momentarily dazed, lost in the tumult of thoughts swirling in his mind. Slowly, he pulled Zhao Min up. When their hands met, he felt Zhao Min's hand was stiff. He immediately realized that when she had suddenly vanished without a trace, and he searched for her with all his might without finding her, Zhao Min had actually had been captured by Zhou Zhiruo. Her acupoints had been sealed, and she had been hidden here. Zhou Zhiruo then deliberately brought her here and said all this right here so that Zhao Min could hear it. If he could not bear to see Zhou Zhiruo and said even the slightest words to praise her or behave affectionately towards her, then he would fall into the trap. In that moment, Zhao Min would truly leave him, not asking anything further. Reflecting on this, he could not suppress his self-reproach, "How shameful!" Sweat ran down his back.

When checking Zhao Min's pulse, he found her chi flowing normally, so she had not suffered any injuries. In the moonlight, he could see Zhao Min's eyes shining with excitement. She looked so lovely and charming. Zhang Wuji was sure she had heard everything he said to Zhou Zhiruo. Although her body could not move and her mouth could not speak, her ears were able to hear everything. He had put forth the feelings of his heart, that he loved her with a love that was "carved in his heart and inscribed in his bones." Zhao Min had heard the sincerity in his voice, and she felt incredibly joyous, almost uncontrollably so.

Zhou Zhiruo leaned in and whispered something in Zhang Wuji’s ear. Zhang Wuji also responded in a low tone. Suddenly Zhou Zhiruo shouted in anger, "Zhang Wuji, you truly do not look at me! Look closely; Miss Zhao has been poisoned—do you think she can still live?"

Zhang Wuji was greatly shocked. "She... she is poisoned?" he asked. "Did you poison her?" He bent down to check Zhao Min, and just as he opened Zhao Min's left eye, he felt a tingling sensation in his back as Zhou Zhiruo had sealed his acupoints.

"Ah!" exclaimed Zhang Wuji. His body swayed.

Zhou Zhiruo's movements were as swift as the wind. Her delicate fingers were powerful as she swiftly sealed five vital points in Zhang Wuji's shoulder, both sides of his lower back, and the middle of his back. Zhang Wuji stumbled and fell.

He saw a green shadow flit past as Zhou Zhiruo drew her sword and aimed it at his chest.

"You cannot escape, and you cannot hide," she declared flatly. "Today I will kill you. What’s more, Yin Li's ghost has always haunted me. I will die too, in the end. I would rather die with you." As she spoke, she raised her sword high, ready to stab Zhang Wuji in the chest.

Suddenly, a woman cried from behind her, "Stop! Zhou Zhiruo, Yin Li is not dead!"

Turning her head, Zhou Zhiruo saw a girl in black moving lightly through the bushes, fingers outstretched to attack her. Zhou Zhiruo tilted her body to sidestep. The woman turned. The moonlight illuminated the side of her beautiful face, albeit covered in scars.

Zhang Wuji saw her clearly; she was none other than his cousin, Yin Li, but the swellings on her face had now disappeared. Although her face was marred by scars, those scars could not cover her beauty. She vaguely resembled the delicate and beautiful young girl who stood beside Jinhua Popo in Butterfly Valley many years ago.

Zhou Zhiruo retreated two steps back, her left palm in front of her chest, the sword in her right hand still aimed at Zhang Wuji's chest. "If you dare to step forward again, my sword will kill him first," she shouted.

Yin Li did not dare to move; she anxiously said, "Why... haven't you done enough wrong?"

"Are you a ghost or a human?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

"I’m certainly human," Yin Li answered.

"Zhu'er!" Suddenly, Zhang Wuji shouted, leaping to embrace Yin Li. "Zhu'er...!" he called again. "You... I truly missed you so much that my heart aches!"

Yin Li let out a muffled scream from surprise, unable to move as Zhang Wuji wrapped his arms around her.

Zhou Zhiruo let out a cold chuckle and said, "If we had not done this, you wouldn't have come out." She turned to release Zhao Min’s acupoint and began to massage her blood vessels and muscles.

Zhao Min had been under Zhou Zhiruo's control all day, left alone after being thrown here; she was furious. Fortunately, then, when she heard Zhang Wuji pouring out his heart, it turned her anger into a burst of joy. But then, with the sudden appearance of Yin Li, a flood of new complications arose in her mind. Old resentments had just passed, and now new anxieties arrived.

Yin Li said angrily, "What’s it to you if you flatter and sweet-talk me? Miss Zhao and Miss Zhou are both here; keep your demeanor in check."

"Hmph," Zhao Min huffed. "So she only has to behave if I and Miss Zhou are here, huh?"

Zhang Wuji said, "I am half overjoyed to see you rise from the dead. Biaomei, how... how have you fared?"

Yin Li pinched his left ear and twisted it painfully.

"Ahh!" shouted Zhang Wuji in pain. "Why are you doing this?"

"You — [The Ugly One](#bookmark=id.gfovxzz4yhyk) — you truly deserve to be minced into thousands of pieces!" Yin Li said. "You... you buried me alive in the ground, making me suffer so much." As she spoke, she struck Zhang Wuji on the chest three times, 'Buk, buk, buk!'

Zhang Wuji did not dare to protect himself with Jiu Yang Shen Gong. He bore the three blows while smiling, saying, "Zhu'er! I truly thought you were... dead. I mourned you many times. You are not dead. This is absolutely marvelous. [Lao Tianye](#bookmark=id.xsuepyj8pjbg) truly has eyes."

"Lao Tianye has eyes, but *you* — this ugly man — do not have any," scolded Yin Li in anger. "You can't even distinguish between someone alive or dead. I truly can't believe it. You apparently hate my ugly and swollen face, so you cruelly buried me without waiting for my breath to cease. You have no heart. You are truly a heartless ugly bastard!"

Once she began to unleash a barrage of insults, her facial expression, voice, and gestures were truly those of the Yin Li he had known so well. Zhang Wuji laughed heartily. As he scratched his head, he said, "Your scolding truly is on point. You’re right. I was quite stupid. I saw your face covered in blood, and you were not breathing, with no heartbeat, thus I thought you had no chance for survival..."

Yin Li leapt forward to pinch his right ear. Zhang Wuji laughed, dodging to the side. He bent down with clasped hands. "Zhu'er, please forgive me."

"I will not forgive you!" Yin Li declared. "At that time, when I regained consciousness, I felt a terrible chill all around me. I turned out to be surrounded by stones! If you wanted to bury me alive, why did you cover me with stones? Why not with mud and dirt, so I wouldn't be able to breathe and would truly die?"

"Thanks to Heaven and Earth, it seems I buried stones above your body," Zhang Wuji said. He could not suppress a glance at Zhou Zhiruo.

Yin Li was very angry. "This woman is exceedingly cruel. I forbid you to look at her," she said.

"Why?" Zhang Wuji asked.

"She is the one who killed me," Yin Li replied. "Why do you still have feelings for her?"

"But you are not dead," interrupted Zhao Min. "How could she be your murderer?"

"I was dead once," said Yin Li. "That made her my killer!"

"Good Zhu'er," Zhang Wuji soothed. "You have escaped death and returned to life. We are all very happy. Why don’t you sit still here for a while, so that you can tell us how you escaped from death?"

Yin Li said, "What do you mean by 'we'? Let me ask you first, when you said 'we,' who were you referring to?"

Laughing, Zhang Wuji said, "There are only four people here. Of course, 'we' means Miss Zhou, Miss Zhao, and myself."

"Hmph!" Yin Li snorted, laughing. "I won’t die. Let’s say you’re happy. How about Miss Zhou and Miss Zhao? Are they also happy? Truly!"

"Miss Yin," Zhou Zhiruo said. "I was very cruel at that time; I wounded you severely. However, I not only regret my actions immensely but I also can never sleep soundly again. Otherwise, why would I be so frightened when encountering you in the woods? Now, seeing you alive and well, all my burdens have lifted. Heaven bears witness; my joy is truly unparalleled."

Yin Li tilted her head and pondered for a moment. She nodded and said, "That makes sense. In truth, I still wish to settle the score with you, but because you have apologized, let’s drop it."

Zhou Zhiruo knelt and wept. "I... I truly have done far too many sins against you."

Yin Li was actually quite fierce, but upon seeing Zhou Zhiruo sincerely acknowledge her wrongdoing, her heart softened. She hurriedly helped Zhou Zhiruo back up, then said, "Zhou Jiejie, let all that has transpired truly be the past; let’s forget everything. Moreover, I am not dead." Grabbing Zhou Zhiruo's hand, she led her to sit side by side.

Brushing her hair aside, Yin Li said, "You cut my face with your sword; that was certainly not without some benefit. My face was already swollen; after being slashed by the sword, the poisonous blood flowed out, and the swellings gradually faded away."

Zhou Zhiruo was enveloped by deep guilt; she did not know what to say.

Zhang Wuji said, "After that incident, Yifu, Zhiruo, and I stayed on the island for some time. Zhu'er, why didn’t you come find us back then?"

"I did not want to find you," Yin Li replied defiantly. "You and Miss Zhou kept whispering sweet nonsense to each other all the time; how could I not be angry hearing all that nonsense? Hmph! 'From now on, my love for you will multiply, even threefold! We as husband and wife, two persons as one body, how could I ever harm you?'” 

In the last few sentences, she mimicked Zhang Wuji's speech. Then continuing, she replicated Zhou Zhiruo's words, "'What if I erred and offended you, you would hit me, scold me, or even kill me? Since childhood, I have not had parents to guide me. Sometimes it is hard to avoid making mistakes.'" She coughed and altered her voice into a man’s deep tone—the mockery was evident, "'Zhiruo, you are my beloved wife. Even if you are in the wrong, I will never scold or blame you.'"

It turned out that while Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo had revealed their hearts to each other, Yin Li had heard it all. As she recited this line by line, Zhou Zhiruo’s face turned crimson, while Zhang Wuji appeared flustered and restless. He furtively glanced toward Zhao Min and saw her face was as pale as paper; thus, he quickly took her hand. Unexpectedly, Zhao Min twisted her hand to pinch his arm with her long nails. Zhang Wuji grimaced in pain, yet he did not dare to voice a sound or move.

Yin Li rummaged in her pocket to take out a wooden plaque. She held it up in front of Zhang Wuji. "Take a good look at this. What is it?" she demanded.

Zhang Wuji looked closer and began to read a line of characters engraved on the plaque. It read, "The Grave of My Beloved Wife, Zhu'er Yin Li. Zhang Wuji Declares with Sincerity." That was the tombstone he had erected at Yin Li's grave on Snake Island.

Yin Li bitterly said, "Once I crawled out of the grave, I saw this board, and I was confused. What is this? Where is that short-lived heartless bastard — Zhang Wuji? I thought about this hundreds of times, without understanding what happened, until I overheard the two of you talking, 'Wuji Gege this' and 'Wuji Gege that.' Suddenly, I started to understand; it turns out Zhang Wuji is Zeng Aniu, and Zeng Aniu is actually Zhang Wuji. You — bastard with no heart — truly deceived me completely!" She raised the plaque high above her head and struck it against Zhang Wuji's head. 'Kreek!' The wooden plaque snapped, shattering into splinters that flew in all directions.

Zhao Min was furious. "Why do you keep hitting him?" she said.

Yin Li laughed heartily. "I enjoy hitting him; what’s it to you? Does your heart hurt?"

Zhao Min blushed and said, "He did this intentionally to lose to you. You cannot distinguish good from bad."

Yin Li laughed. "Why do you say I cannot distinguish right from wrong?" she asked. "No need to worry, I will not fight this ugly man for you. My heart has long been given to someone else, that evil Zhang Wuji. Regarding this ugly man, I do not care whether he calls himself Zhang Wuji or Zeng Aniu; I entirely dislike him."

Turning to Zhang Wuji, she spoke softly, "Aniu Gege, you have always treated me kindly, and I thank you. But long ago, my heart has been given to that evil man Zhang Wuji. I will find him. Tell me, how do you think, if I find him, will he still want to hit me, scold me, or even bite me?"

Without waiting for Zhang Wuji's answer, she turned and walked away slowly.

Suddenly, Zhang Wuji understood everything. The one truly loved by Zhu'er was the Zhang Wuji in her memory — the Zhang Wuji she met in Butterfly Valley, who hit and bit her, that stubborn Zhang Wuji who refused to follow her, not the Zhang Wuji right now, who had grown up, tolerant, and always treated others well. A third of his heart ached, another third felt unwilling to let her go, and the last third felt a wave of relief. His gaze followed Yin Li’s figure until her shadow disappeared into the darkness of the night. He knew that for her entire life, Yin Li would always remember that strong teenage boy from Butterfly Valley and would always seek to find him. He realized that Yin Li would never find the person she was looking for, but one could also say that Yin Li had indeed found him because that boy always lived in her heart. Was it not often the case that one's original self, in real life, is not as good as what resides in our memory of them?

Zhou Zhiruo sighed and said, "This is all my fault. I have harmed her so severely that in the end, she went mad."

But Zhang Wuji thought, "Perhaps she’s a bit deranged, and perhaps it’s all because of me. But compared to all others who consider themselves sane, she may not be any less unhappy."

On the contrary, Zhao Min had a different thought. Yin Li was gone, but what about Zhou Zhiruo? Yin Li was not dead, Xie Xun had also been found, alive and well. The martial arts book contained in the Yitian Sword, along with the military strategy book within the Dragon-slaying Sabre, as well as the sabre itself, had all been successfully recovered and returned to Zhang Wuji. In short, it seemed that all of Zhou Zhiruo's cruel actions and every other fault were no longer exacerbated. Although Song Qingshu had indeed killed Mo Shenggu because of her, that was Song Qingshu's own fault; Zhou Zhiruo had not known about it at all. Furthermore, she surely had not participated in orchestrating that catastrophe. Previously, Zhang Wuji had been engaged to her, and it was clear she was not the kind to betray trust and loyalty.

Zhou Zhiruo stood. "Let’s go!" she said.

"Where to?" asked Zhao Min.

Zhou Zhiruo replied, "When I saw Zhang Zhong come rushing to look for him at Shaolin earlier," she turned her face to Zhang Wuji, "It seems something very important has occurred within Ming Jiao."

Zhao Min smiled at Zhang Wuji and said in a comforting tone, "Yin Li is gone, pursuing the Prince from Fairyland that resides in her heart. But there is still *me* and Zhou Jiejie, who will accompany you in building your very own Fairyland."

Zhou Zhiruo gazed sharply at her and then snorted, asking, "What do you mean by that?"

"Nothing," Zhao Min replied lightly. "People say I like to boast; my words are *nonsense*, so just ignore it."

Zhang Wuji’s heart turned cold. "I can’t ignore the matters of Ming Jiao just because of women," he thought, and he quickly said, "Let’s go find out what is happening!"
