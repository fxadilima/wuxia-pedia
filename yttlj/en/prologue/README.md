# Prologue

Current Position: Ki Son-yeo is 5 years old, learning Wu Wei and qinggong with Duoluo Haoyu.

New Event: At age 12, she inadvertently kills two palace bodyguards to avoid being taken as a concubine by the Crown Prince of Goryeo. She flees north to Dadu, then Shangdu, and eventually meets the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao."

This means there's a 7-year time jump and a dramatic shift in her circumstances.

Here's how you could structure this next segment, following directly from the qinggong lesson:

---

**Transitioning to Ki Son-yeo's Flight:**
(Following the qinggong lesson...)

"Over the next seven years, Ki Son-yeo's world expanded and deepened under Duoluo Haoyu's patient tutelage. She learned the fluidity of qinggong, the subtle power of Wu Wei, and the profound wisdom hidden in the ordinary world around her. She grew from a giggling five-year-old into a quick-witted, agile twelve-year-old, with a mind as sharp as any scholar's and a spirit as free as the river's current. Her bond with her master deepened with each passing season, his lessons shaping not just her martial skills but her very spirit.

Then, just as she was blossoming into a young woman, the gentle flow of her life in Haengju was violently disrupted. Master Duoluo, her beloved teacher, finally succumbed to his old age, leaving her without his guiding presence. It was barely a month later, while she was still reeling from the loss, that her world truly shattered."

**Then, the Inciting Incident:**
This will be a critical scene to write, showing her desperation and the raw application of her nascent skills.

*Key elements to include in that scene:*

- **The Crown Prince's Entitlement**: Clearly show the oppressive nature of his demand to take her as a concubine.
- **Ki Son-yeo's Desperation**: Emphasize her fear and panic at being alone and facing this threat without her master.
- **The "Inadvertent" Kills**: Portray how her actions, driven by pure self-preservation and perhaps an untrained application of the Wu Wei principles (using their momentum against them, or subtle evasions leading to their downfall), result in the guards' deaths. This highlights her youth and lack of malicious intent.
- The Escape: Describe her immediate, terrified flight northward. Emphasize the harshness of the journey, alone and driven by fear, as she makes her way towards Dadu and Shangdu.

**Connecting to the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao":**

- Once she reaches Dadu/Shangdu, describe her vulnerability and exhaustion before she encounters the group.
- Tajkis, Fan Yao, Yang Xiao, Yin Susu, and the other two girls: This is where you'll introduce their meeting. You have creative freedom to define their dynamic and how they came to be known as the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao," diverging from Jin Yong's original Ming Cult structure. This offers exciting possibilities for unique interactions and backstories within this new group.

This revised approach ensures Duoluo Haoyu's death adds to the pathos and heightens the stakes for Ki Son-yeo's dramatic escape and subsequent journey.

In 1314 King Chungseon passed the throne to his son King Chungsuk. In 1321 King Chungsuk fathered his son King Chunghye. This prompted the previous crown prince of Goryeo, Öljeyitü, to establish an alliance with Emperor Sidibala, and King Chungsuk was thus interned in 1321. However, Sidibala was assassinated in 1323 and Öljeitü's plan was aborted.

King Chungsuk, who was allowed to return to Goryeo in 1325, passed the throne to King Chunghye in 1330 but was reinstated after two years because King Chunghye was deposed by Yuan dynasty. Letters uncovered from the Vatican potentially suggest that the first contacts between the Vatican and Korea began during Chungsuk's reign, 261 years before Spanish Catholic priest Gregorio de Céspedes visited Joseon, the successor state of Goryeo, though some Korean researchers believe the letters could potentially have been forgeries.[2][3] On December 13, 1335, after having a dream, the King changed his personal name from To (도; 燾) to Man (만; 卍).[4]

King Chungsuk died in 1339.

Here's the historical facts found after this:

- 4 October 1323, Yesün Temür, cousin of Gegeen Khan, becomes emperor of the Yuan dynasty.
- The Comprehensive Institutions of the Great Yuan is promulgated, consisting of 2,400 legal documents divided into 4 categories

---

In 1323 when Shidebala Gegeen Khan (Emperor Yingzong) was assassinated by Grand Censor Tegshi and Esen Temur, the rebellious group welcomed Yesün Temür since his mother was Buyan Kelmish of the Khunggirad clan. According to the official history of the Yuan, Yesün Temür caused Tegshi's envoy Walus to be seized and sent notice of the plot to Shidibala Khan, but the messengers arrived too late.[4]

Yesün Temür was not merely the principal beneficiary of the conspiracy but was also very likely a participant.[2] It is said that his administrator Dawlat Shah had established close contact with the conspirators. After receiving the imperial seal sent by the conspirators, he ascended to the throne on the bank of the Kherlen River in Mongolia on October 4, 1323. Esen Temur was made the grand councilor of the right, and Tegshi the manager of the Bureau of Military Affairs. Upon learning that he would incur suspicion as a party to the murders, he suddenly reversed his policy and ordered Tegshi, Esen Temur, and others to be put to death. Under the leadership of Chang Kuei, the late Khagan's officials sent a letter to Yesün Temür urging him to accept the throne and to punish the conspirators.[5] He sent troops to Dadu and Shangdu and had rebellious officers executed before he entered Dadu because he feared becoming their puppet. The five princes who had been involved were exiled to Yunnan, Hainan, and other distant places.

Chinese officials repeatedly urged Yesün Temür to extend the purge to all former allies of Temuder and Tegshi and their families, but Yesün Temür Khan refused.[6] He issued an amnesty decree, and the confiscated properties of the executed conspirators were returned to their families.[7]

---

As a ruler who had seized the throne by intrigue and violence, Yesün Temür tried to win the widest possible support. To secure support as Emperor of China from the Han populace, he duly showed his respect for the Confucian tradition from the beginning of his reign.[9] Nevertheless, Muslim and Mongol officials from the steppe constituted the majority of posts in the Yuan government during this period. Kumeijil and Tas Temur served as grand councillars of the right; Dawlat Shah served as the manager of the governmental affairs of the Central Secretariat (中書省), then as censor in chief, and finally as grand councillary of the left; and Andachu, the manager of the Bureau of Military Affairs.[10]

In addition to Dawlat Shah, there were two Muslims, Ubaidullah and Bayanchar, who served as managers of governmental affairs in the Secretariat. Mahmud Shah and Hasan Khoja managed the Bureau of Military Affairs. In contrast with the Muslims, Han officials exerted little influence on the administration. The high point of the Mongol partner-merchants' operations came under Yesün Temür, whose administration exempted Christians and Muslims from any corvee payments and guaranteed huge payments promised by the Mongolian nobility in return for luxury goods (тансаг).[11]

### Xiang Long Shiba Zhang (降龍十八掌)

1. **Kanglong You Hui (亢龍有悔)**
   "Naga di langit merasa menyesal", atau "Naga sombong merasa menyesal". Karena 'Naga' adalah simbol kaisar atau pajabat tinggi, terutama sekali jika dihubungkan dengan 'Kang', yang bisa berarti 'arogan', 'tinggi' atau terlalu percaya diri, berlebihan — 'menyesal' di sini apa yang akan dilakukannya? 

2. **Feilong Zai Tian 飛龍在天**
   The famous and fearsomely powerful martial art of the Beggars Clan. It was created by the book, I Ching. The second stroke in the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms (飛龍在天) is based on the Chinese adage that a dragon in the sky will be able to spot men of greatness below it. This suggests that the dragon, from its elevated position, will have an overview on the affairs of the world hence being able to keep track of mortal ongoing and spot men of great deeds and virtue.

3. **Jianlong Zai Tian 見龍在田**:
   Here the effects of the light-giving power begin to manifest themselves. In terms of human affairs, this means that the great man makes his appearance in his chosen field of activity. As yet he has no commanding position but is still with his peers. However, what distinguishes him form the others is his seriousness of purpose, his unqualified reliability, and the influence he exerts on his environment with out conscious effort. Such a man is destined to gain great influence and to set the world in order. Therefore it is favorable to see him.

   "Di sinilah pengaruh kekuatan pemberi cahaya mulai terwujud. Dalam konteks urusan manusia, ini berarti bahwa orang hebat itu muncul di bidang kegiatan yang dipilihnya. Sampai saat ini ia belum memiliki posisi komando tetapi masih bersama dengan rekan-rekannya. Namun, yang membedakannya dari yang lain adalah keseriusannya dalam tujuan, keandalannya yang tak terbatas, dan pengaruh yang ia berikan pada lingkungannya tanpa usaha yang sadar. Orang seperti itu ditakdirkan untuk mendapatkan pengaruh besar dan mengatur dunia. Oleh karena itu, sangatlah baik untuk melihatnya."

1. Yang Rui (楊睿):
   Rui (睿): Means "wise," "perceptive," or "astute." It suggests intelligence, foresight, and a keen understanding
   
2. Yang Jun (楊俊):
   Jun (俊): Means "handsome," "talented," "outstanding," or "heroic." It implies exceptional ability and admirable qualities.

*With Ki Son-yeo now gaining deeper insights into the philosophical and political meanings of the Xianglong Shi Ba Zhang stances, how will this knowledge begin to shape her perception of her own future, particularly regarding her impending marriage and potential role in the Goryeo court?*

1. Ki Son-yeo's future is yet to come, it will be shaped gradually in the nexts encounters.
2. She never like the marriage idea from the very start.
3. Her role in the Goryeo court will be defined much later, when she becomes influential Concubine/Empress of Toghon Temur.

In the next section, we will oncover a secret story that never been touched deeply by Jin Yong, at least he just mentioned it like a fairy tale. We will *demistify* exactly one character in Yitian Tulong Ji, who seems to be more or less like a divine 'goddess' — the Yellow-Robed Maiden, through a simple, ralatable and believable background.

When Yang Guo kill Mongke Khan, followed by the meeting in Huashan, it can be safely assumed to be somewhere near 1260 or 1261, when Yang Guo himself was already around 36-38, and what about Xiao Longnu? She was, logically, over 40! Then, they dissappear without a trace! That's logical! They want to build their own family, unlike Guo Jing's family, who already established, Yang Guo and Xiao Longnu's private life has just started!

We will say that both of them, with Xiao Longnu already over 40, still managed to leave two sons. Each born in 1263 and 1265. Then it can be said — if both married at young age (20s) — in around 1284 - 1290, they already have children, with surnames 'Yang', continuing Yang Guo's decendants. It will then becoming relatable to the presence of the Yellow-Robed Maiden, who, in this case, was about 5 years older than Zhang Wuji! She supposed to be born at around 1325-1327. Would be reasonable if her father was one of Yang Guo's grandchildren, with a surname "Yang'! Thus, she herself was Yang Guo's great granddaughter!

In our current narrative, **Yang Dao** is the one with 'Yang' family name!

**Highlight in 1325:**

- Bronze "thousand-ball thunder-cannons" on four wheeled carriages appear in the Yuan dynasty.

During the Yuan Dynasty, Xinjiang was not a unified province under direct Yuan rule, but rather a region with shifting control and administrative structures. Initially, the Yuan established the Beiting (别失八里行省) province, but much of Xinjiang fell under the influence of the Chagatai Khanate, a separate Mongol khanate, after 1286. The Yuan did retain some control over eastern Xinjiang, establishing the Qara-hoja commandery (哈剌火州總管府) in that area. 
Yuan Dynasty - World History Encyclopedia

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- Initial Yuan Control:
The Yuan Dynasty initially brought parts of present-day Xinjiang under its control, including the area of Bechbaliq (别失八里), which was designated as a province. 

- Chagatai Khanate Influence:
However, the Chagatai Khanate, another Mongol khanate, gradually expanded its influence in the region, eventually controlling most of Xinjiang. 

- Yuan's Limited Presence:
While the Yuan lost direct control over much of the area, they maintained some presence, particularly in eastern Xinjiang, where the Qara-hoja commandery was established. 

- Administrative Structures:
The Yuan did introduce administrative structures, like the Beiting Command and the Anxi province, to govern parts of the Western Regions (including Xinjiang). 

- Breakthrough in Governance:
The Yuan's system of administrative provinces was a significant development in the governance of Xinjiang, marking the first time such a system was applied in the Western Regions. 
- Later Ming Dynasty:
The Yuan Dynasty was eventually replaced by the Ming Dynasty, and the Genghisid rulers retreated to the Mongolian Plateau.
