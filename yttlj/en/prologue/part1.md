# Prologue
## *Haengju, 1320: The Smart Little Fairy*

One afternoon in Haengju, a city in southern Goryeo, a girl of about five was listening intently to her teacher's story. Her eyes barely blinked. Occasionally, she'd ask questions with eager curiosity in Han Chinese that sounded almost indistinguishable from the dialect of Jiangnan residents. She was called Ki Son-yeo[^ki-sonyeo], but her teacher had given her a unique and beautiful name, 'Qi Shengniang'[^shengniang], using her own surname 'Ki' (pronounced in Han Chinese), and adding a name meaning 'Holy Maiden.'

[^shengniang]: Sheng Niang (聖娘), 'Holy Maiden'.
[^ki-sonyeo]: Her surname is Ki '기', in Chinese character is (奇). The two characters Son-yeo (소녀) simply mean 'girl' and would also be translated as 'Niang' (娘) in Han Chinese.

Her martial arts teacher, Douluo Haoyu, was a man of about ninety, a former member of the Beggars' Sect (Kai Pang) who had eventually come to Goryeo and settled in Haengju. Douluo Haoyu married a Goryeo woman, and his daughter now had a son and two daughters. His three grandchildren were roughly the same age as this cherished, sole female disciple. In Haengju, he had originally worked only as a farmer, but eventually, a nobleman named Ki Ja-oh discovered that Douluo Haoyu was a high-level martial arts expert. At the time, Ki Ja-oh had no idea that Douluo Haoyu had previously been an eight-pouch elder of the Beggars' Sect.

Haoyu himself was quite elderly at the time, and he happened to be passing through a bustling market. A royal officer was arguing with a female shop owner because the officer refused to pay for the food he had eaten, claiming the shop was overcharging.

From a distance, Douluo Haoyu watched the commotion. Like everyone else, he didn't feel the price set by the shop owner was excessive. The officer then intended to leave quickly after smashing a table to show off his strength as a man and intimidate the shop owner. No one dared to defend the woman, and Haoyu couldn't restrain himself. He secretly placed his wooden staff near the foot of the enraged, wide-striding officer. The officer stumbled but didn't fall. He glared at everyone around him, barking, "Who tripped me?"

One man standing near Haoyu certainly saw the act but deliberately didn't say anything. At that moment, Haoyu himself had quickly moved several steps from his original position without being clearly seen by the officer.

This afternoon, when Doulou Jing, the son of Douluo Houyu, recounted the story of his father, Ki Son-yeo giggled. "Didn't Shifu get caught at that time?"

Douluo Jing said, "Do you want *Shishu*'s father to get caught or not?"

"Of course not!" Ki Son-yeo said, grinning widely, showing his neat, white teeth. He turned to his teacher, "Shifu, Shengniang wants to see how Shifu blocks that person's feet!"

Douluo Haoyu, smiling faintly, said, "Ah Jing, try demonstrating."

Ki Son-yeo then walked to the right, passing by Douluo Jing, who was also considered her martial uncle. Suddenly his uncle's right leg appeared in front of her walking foot. Of course, the girl immediately fell. Her uncle quickly caught her, preventing her from falling to the floor. But she protested, "This method is difficult! Shengniang can't do it, it takes a lot of strength!"

Douluo Haoyu's old eyes lit up, as he said, "Shengniang, you are too fixated on *ways*. Actually, Shifu doesn't do it that way either. There are many *ways* to do things, the most correct is *Wu Wei*[^wu-wei]."

Ki Son-yeo looked at his master curiously. "Wu Wei?" paused, then asked, "Shifu, *dizi*"[^dizi] doesn't understand."

[^wu-wei]: Wu Wei (無為), this can be translated as "effortless".
[^dizi]: Dizi (弟子), "Disciple". This is how a disciple addresses himself in front of his master.

"Now, you see, Shifu is old now," Douluo Haoyu said, laughing. "Your uncle, of course, is much stronger. How could Shifu trip him?"

Douluo Jing smiled faintly. He knew what his father meant, but not yet how his father would demonstrate it. Suddenly, his father stood up, approached him abruptly, and exclaimed, "Hey!" extending his right hand towards Douluo Jing's face, palm open. Startled, Douluo Jing instinctively stepped his right foot back. But then he immediately fell. The next second, he realized the move was just a feint. His father had actually placed his staff with his left hand behind Douluo Jing's leg. He fell because he hadn't anticipated this.

He laughed as he got up, looking at Ki Son-yeo who was giggling. "Father cheated!"

Douluo Haoyu looked surprised. "Did I push you just now? You fell on your own." He turned to his young disciple, winking, "Now — that's Wu Wei. So it's not entirely doing nothing."

He led them to the front yard of his house, where a small, clear river flowed westward. In the middle of this little river was a large rock that seemed to impede the not-too-swift current. Douluo Haoyu usually taught Ki Son-yeo atop this large rock.

"Look at the water, what do you see?" he said, taking Ki Son-yeo's hand and lightly guiding her onto the rock where they usually practiced kung fu. From atop the rock, they could see the river's flow from every direction. Douluo Jing followed his father, leaping lightly.

Ki Son-yeo giggled and said, "Water, of course."

But Douluo Haoyu wouldn't give up. "Can you see its shape?"

Ki Son-yeo now looked confused. "Shifu, water has no shape."

Now Douluo Jing laughed. Since childhood, he had often heard this question from his father. He picked up a large, hollow piece of bamboo, which Ki Son-yeo usually used for drinking. He filled it with river water and said, "See, now the water becomes bamboo."

"Oh!" Ki Son-yeo exclaimed, her eyes instantly sparkling as she clapped her hands happily. "So water actually has many shapes. Water can change!"

"And what else do you see?" her teacher asked.

Ki Son-yeo remembered her teacher's story about the great flood that devastated Zhongyuan due to the overflowing Yellow River. She eagerly said, "Shifu, water can even collapse large buildings and kill many people!"

Her teacher and Douluo Jing laughed. "That's true," Douluo Jing said, "But you can't judge water as bad just because people drown or there are floods. Can you imagine if there were no water? We couldn't drink, all our plants would die."

"Now, try to see how the water flows," Douluo Haoyu said, pointing eastward. "This water comes from the east, which is higher ground. We're standing on this large rock, but the water keeps flowing. Of course, it would overflow if more places were covered. But water will find its own way, through the gaps in the rocks, until it reaches its original destination."

"Ah! So that's what Shifu means, there are many ways to do everything," Ki Son-yeo said, her eyes sparkling. "Like this water, it can go around the rock, it can seep through the ground, it can go over it if there's a flood!"

"Exactly," Douluo Haoyu said. "Are you afraid you can't do something that requires great strength? But ants can make a person run without effort." He carried the child to leap across the river, where many mulberry trees stood. Many fallen fruits invited ants to come. "Look, they gather there easily. What do you see here?"

This time, Ki Son-yeo immediately cheered, "Of course they come, because what fell is sweet! Ants like sweet things!"

Her words this time made Douluo Jing murmur, "So, if we want to invite ants, just give them sugar... Hmm..." He then asked Ki Son-yeo, "What do you think we should do if we want to invite people?"

Ki Son-yeo grinned widely, saying, "Father says people like money the most, so just give them money."

Douluo Haoyu's eyes twinkled. He scooped water from the riverbank using the bamboo his son had brought, saying as he walked back, "You can indeed invite ants to scare people. They'll come if there's sugar. But..." He poured water from the bamboo over a mulberry fruit swarming with ants, "if that 'sugar' isn't there, the ants will leave. And what if the person you're trying to scare turns against you?"

Ki Son-yeo was actually thinking about how to scare a boy her age, whom she didn't know but who often seemed to come with other guests to see her father. For some inexplicable reason, the boy often approached her, and she didn't like it. She was thinking of smearing lots of sugar on his clothes if he dared come near. Now, after her teacher doused the ants, she felt this idea wasn't so good. She mumbled, "So, before scaring someone, we need to learn how to run away first..."

Her teacher smiled, took her hand, and said, "Yes, that's right. Before you learn to use a sword, first learn what *qinggong* is." Ki Son-yeo then felt her body float as her teacher lightly leaped back onto the large rock where they usually practiced kung fu.

After Khayishan's death, Ayurbarwada reneged on his promise, appointing his own son, Shidibala, as the Crown Prince of the Yuan Dynasty. This marked the beginning of a deep rift and contention between two major factions: his own supporters and those of his elder brother, Khayishan.

Now, on this day, Ayurbarwada himself had passed away, eliciting a myriad of reactions among both the common people and within the government.

Ayurbarwada, the second son of Darmabala and Dagi of the Khonggirad clan, was a great-grandson of Kublai Khan. He had studied under Li Meng, a Confucian scholar, which significantly influenced his political conduct from a young age. Under Khayishan's leadership, he was appointed as the Head of Zhongshu Sheng (中書省), the Central Secretariat. He was surrounded by a large number of Han bureaucrats, including Chen Hao, Wang I, Wang Yueh, Zhao Mengfu, Wang Chieh, Chan Yaoho, Shang-ye, Yao sui, and Hsia ku, as well as artists like Shang cheng and Wang Cheng-peng. He was fluent in both speaking and writing Han Chinese, complementing his deep love for Han calligraphy and painting, and his profound knowledge of Confucian teachings and Han history.

Long before his ascension to the throne, he and his elder brother, Khayishan, were sidelined from the political arena by Bulugan Khatun, the empress of Temur Khan, who acted on behalf of her ailing husband. After Temur's death, Bulugan, who was from the Bayaud clan, attempted to elevate Khayishan and Ayurbarwada's uncle, Ananda, a powerful Muslim who served as the Governor of Zhongxing. This attempt was discovered by Darkhan Harghasun, the You Chengxiang (右丞相) or Right Grand Counselor at the time. Darkhan Harghasun then summoned Ayurbarwada back to Dadu from Huaizhou. Together, they successfully orchestrated a plan to imprison Bulugan and Ananda.

In short, Khayishan subsequently ascended the throne and appointed Ayurbarwada as Crown Prince. The two brothers promised each other that their children would rule in alternating succession.

Unlike previous successions, which often led to disputes, when Khayishan died, Ayurbarwada smoothly stepped onto the throne.

The Khonggirat faction under Temuder and Dagi became even more powerful at the court. They considered Shidibala an obstacle, and wouldn't let him rule for too long.


## *Nanpo, September 4, 1323: The Reform of Confucian Emperor*

Shidibala's powerful grandmother Dagi installed Shidibala as Crown Prince in 1316, and then as Khan, since he was mothered by a Khonggirad khatun. He was made the nominal head of both the Secretariat and the Bureau of Military Affairs one year later. *Common people in Dadu saw this as a very promising new era, especially among the Han who held high hopes for his strong Confucian principles*.

At one time, his father Ayurbarwada had even toyed with the idea of abdicating the throne in favor of Shidibala. Dagi's protégé Temuder was made as tutor to the heir apparent, Shidibala, *after he failed to increase tax revenue*.

Between Ayurbarwada's death in March 1320 and his own death in October 1322, Temüder attained a great power with the full support of Dagi. Immediately after her grandson's succession, Dagi reinstated Temüder as Minister of the Secretariat and took politics into her own hands more openly than during Ayurbarwada's reign.

Despite Shidibala's aim to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, *Temuder's faction* linked up with the Alani guard and assassinated Shidibala in 1323. *This was the first violent transition struggle in the Yuan dynasty's history*, which is also known as the Coup d'état at Nanpo (南坡之變), that an emperor was overthrown by a group led by a non-Borjigin.

## *Haengju, February 1324: A Little Fairy's Understanding of Power*

When news of Shidibala's assassination reached Douluo Haoyu's household, Ki Son-yeo, then almost nine years old, had already mastered the qinggong taught by her master, leaping onto the large rock in the middle of the river and returning without anyone's help. Her master had also begun teaching her the fundamentals of Yue Nu Jian Fa using a wooden sword.

As she sat before her master's martial uncle and Douluo Haoyu himself, near their bamboo hut, Ki Son-yeo overheard Douluo Jing remark, "The people's newfound hope, vanished just like that...! Truly cruel!"

Then her father responded, "They even dared to ally with the palace guards to kill the emperor; this is the beginning of a great war within Kublai Khan's own family. Since ancient times, the ambition of those around the emperor has always been the problem. Now, if they are not satisfied, they dare to kill the emperor. So, who should the people truly consider the strongest?"

Ki Son-yeo interjected with a laugh, "The strongest? Of course, Shifu!"

Her words made Douluo Haoyu, who now often leaned on a bamboo couch, burst into laughter. "Aiyaaa, good child, you make this poor old man sound like a god. You might have kungfu as high as the heavens, but when you're old, you can only ponder everything on a couch like this with your eyes closed. Genghis Khan begged to meet Qiu Chuji, making that old man walk thousands of li, just to say the same thing — no one can live forever. People are always looking for fortune tellers to predict what will happen in the future. I find that very foolish. There is only one thing that is truly certain in this world, and they deliberately blind themselves to it, seeking things they consider magical."

Driven by curiosity, Ki Son-yeo offered her bamboo cup so Douluo Haoyu could drink, then asked, "Shifu, what is that most certain thing?"

Old Douluo Haoyu's eyes twinkled. "You don't know? Of course, all of us, sooner or later, will surely die. That's the only thing certain to me; beyond that, everything is uncertain."

Ki Son-yeo was silent for a moment, then became curious about another matter, "Shifu, what does that Dadu business have to do with us here?"

Douluo Haoyu turned to his son. "Ah Jing, have you not told her who that brat is who often visits Shengniang's father's house?"

Douluo Jing seemed hesitant, not answering immediately, creating a brief silence. The rustle of bamboo leaves in the pre-spring breeze adorned their small gathering in Douluo Haoyu's cottage yard. The gurgle of the river current sounded like the accompanying music for a traditional Goryeo folk dance, which Ki Son-yeo's mother had recently begun teaching her.

Then, somewhat reluctantly, Douluo Jing replied, "Shengniang, that *prince* will apparently be your husband later..."

Little Ki Son-yeo's eyebrows shot up as she sharply interjected, "Husband? Prince? What husband? A prince from where?"

Seeing her reaction, Douluo Haoyu sighed, shook his head sadly, then lay back on the bamboo couch, closing his eyes to ponder. The prince's name was Wang Jeong, son of the King of Goryeo, Wang To, who had inherited the throne as King Chungsuk of Goryeo in 1314. He was granted the Mongolian name 'Aratnashiri'. This had prompted Goryeo's then-Crown Prince, Wang Ko, who was actually Wang To's uncle, to immediately forge an alliance with Shidibala in Dadu. In Douluo Haoyu's eyes, the problems within the Goryeo court were as complex as those that had plagued Zhongyuan throughout history and now the Yuan Dynasty, all revolving around succession struggles. He absolutely disliked the idea of his disciple being entangled in such matters, but it seemed Ki Ja-oh had already agreed to it—after all, Wang To was their King, and a royal decree was beyond objection.

Feeling her master was ignoring her questions, Ki Son-yeo shook his shoulder, whining, almost crying. "Shifu, dizi doesn't want to get married! Dizi doesn't like that boy! Shifu must help dizi."

Douluo Jing tried to comfort her, pointing to the river and saying, "Shengniang, do you still remember what we saw about water?" He then let out a helpless sigh, glancing at his father, who remained silent with closed eyes.

But this time, the lesson about water held no appeal for Ki Son-yeo; she returned to her master, whining more loudly. "Shifu, dizi truly doesn't want to. That Wang Jeong likes to bother girls; dizi doesn't like him at all."

Ki Son-yeo's strong objection reminded Douluo Haoyu of Guo Jing's daughter, Guo Xiang, though with different problems and backgrounds. One of the most admired leaders of the Beggar's Sect (Kai Pang) for Douluo Haoyu was Huang Rong herself, even though Huang Rong was reluctant to be the leader of Kai Pang. Indeed, after Huang Rong stepped down, Lu Youjiao died tragically without mastering the Dog Beating Staff properly, and then Yelu Qi did not succeed much in developing Kai Pang. At that time, Huang Rong's attention was firmly fixed on countering Kublai Khan's attack on Xiangyang, only assisting her husband.

Jinlun Fawang and Möngke Khan had died, but that did not mean Guo Xiang's personal problems were resolved. The girl never appeared in Xiangyang again, merely wandering alone, aimlessly, searching for something she already knew could never be achieved: marrying Yang Guo. She never even met Yang Guo again after they all parted ways at Huashan.

Vaguely, though not yet entirely clear, Douluo Haoyu saw a path forward. He said calmly, "Believe me, for now, you won't be marrying anyone. Your qinggong is good enough, but your Yue Nu Jian Fa isn't yet. Shifu wants to see it again."

These words somewhat relieved Ki Son-yeo but confused Douluo Jing. As Ki Son-yeo resumed practicing her sword techniques, he asked, "Father, why give the child false hope?"

His father opened his eyes, glanced at him briefly, then closed them again, saying, "You see it as false hope? I don't. Observe the child's practice."

---

The next day, Ki Ja-oh, while enjoying breakfast with his family, said with a beaming face, "Haha! Now Wang Ko's plan has naturally failed, after the Khagan was assassinated!" He had never liked Wang Ko, who clearly harbored ambitions to seize the throne from King Chungsuk. His family was generally tired of hearing him curse Wang Ko's name at every breakfast.

His wife, Yi Haeng-gom, merely laughed to match his story, saying, "You mean Son-yeo will have a chance to become the empress later, right?"

All their much older sons, Ki Sik, Ki Ch'ol, Ki Won, Ki Chu, and Ki Yun, burst into laughter. Ki Ch'ol said, "Mother guessed correctly!"

However, hearing them mention her nickname, Ki Son-yeo furrowed her brow, saying sharply, "I don't want to marry that Wang Jeong!"

Immediately, the cheerful atmosphere was replaced by tension. All eyes stared at her, full of reprimand. Yi Haeng-gom glanced anxiously at her husband. This foolish child shouldn't say anything here, while they were eating, she thought.

Ki Sik asked, raising an eyebrow, "Do you want all of us to be executed?"

What was on Ki Son-yeo's mind at that moment was her master's 'promise': 'Believe me, for now, you won't be marrying anyone.' Then, 'Yue Nu Jian Fa', that sword art, the sword! She then said, imitating her master, "Believe me, I won't be marrying anyone right now." She smiled mysteriously, which her older brothers interpreted as defiance.

Their father cleared his throat. He deeply loved Ki Son-yeo, the youngest of them all. In this family, no one had ever scolded her. Without forcing or saying anything else that would displease his beloved daughter, he then diverted attention to his wife. "Haeng-gom, perhaps you should teach our child to play music and dance. This is important; it can calm the soul."

Smiling, his wife replied, "Oh, she's already begun learning a few weeks ago. Son-yeo, try playing that zither!"

This time, Ki Son-yeo joyfully obeyed her mother's command. In truth, her master had a daughter older than Duoluo Haoyu, now living with her husband also in Haengju, whom she affectionately called 'Aunt Lian' (蓮, meaning 'Lotus'). Long before her parents began teaching her to play the zither, sing, and dance, Aunt Lian had already perfectly instructed her. Because of this, her mother was astonished to see her learn so quickly.

She demonstrated her mastery of zither playing while singing, then performed several dances taught by her own mother, which she combined with a sword dance—the essence of Yue Nu Jian Fa—transformed into a flowing performance. This demonstration earned thunderous applause from both her parents and her older brothers.

"Father," Ki Ch'ol exclaimed, "now Son-yeo truly deserves to be a future empress!"

Immediately, Ki Son-yeo retorted sharply, "If you want empress, *you* be empress. Not me!"

Ki Sik and the other brothers exchanged glances, a subtle shake of their heads conveying their exasperation. This little sister was truly stubborn.

Feeling her sister was truly defiant, Ki Won rose from his chair, angry. "At the very least, from now on, you must behave better whenever Wang Jeong comes! Don't argue!"

Feeling outmatched by their authority, Ki Son-yeo turned to her mother. "*Eomma*[^eomma], this isn't fair! Son-yeo doesn't like that Wang Jeong!"

Smiling faintly, her mother simply said, "Just singing, playing the zither, and dancing—no one is telling you to get married. It's not difficult, is it?" Speaking to a stubborn child like Ki Son-yeo couldn't involve force, she thought to herself. She'd have to try a different approach after this.

Though her mother's words weren't entirely convincing to Ki Son-yeo, she held onto her master's promise. She forced herself to obey, recalling her master's lesson about the flow of river water. However, secretly, she began to think, Yue Nu Jian Fa was good, and she would definitely train even harder. But for this situation, she couldn't face it with a wooden sword! Secretly, she began to look for opportunities to steal a weapon from her father or her brothers.

Duoluo Haoyu's promise was no empty talk. King Chungsuk was indeed made king, but according to Yuan Dynasty regulations, he was also forced to become a political hostage in Dadu since 1321 and had not yet returned. Even if he were to return, it certainly wouldn't be anytime soon. How would they perform a marriage between the children while their king was held hostage in Dadu?

Feeling her sister was truly defiant, Ki Won rose from his chair, angry. "At the very least, from now on, you must behave better every time Wang Jeong comes! Don't argue!"

[^eomma]: Eomma 엄마, is the familiar way a child calls his mother in those days, similar to 'Niang' in Zhongyuan. A more formal term is Eomeoni (어머니), which is more or less 'Muqin' (母親).


## *Haengju, April 1324: A Secret Blade and a Shifting Throne*

A few months later, Ki Son-yeo managed to steal a dagger belonging to Ki Yun, which was very sharp and beautiful in her eyes. She always carried it in her inner pocket, secretly practicing her master's Yue Nu Jian Fa with this dagger every night, without anyone else knowing. But of course, she couldn't hide such a thing from Douluo Haoyu, who always observed her closely.

Meanwhile, news of Yesün Temür's enthronement as Khagan and Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, replacing Shidibala, had reached Douluo Haoyu and his son. They discussed it every night. One thing that interested them most was that Yesün Temür was known to greatly love *the original Mongolian traditions*, contrary to the views of Kublai, Khayishan, and Ayurbarwada. He was clearly different from Shidibala.

Yesün Temür's father was Gammala, the eldest son of Zhenjin, who was the official heir—Kublai Khan's chosen crown prince, who unfortunately died before Kublai himself. Zhenjin was known as a loyal follower of Confucianism and clearly adhered to the same principles as Kublai, perhaps even more deeply. After Zhenjin's death, Gammala was appointed as *Jinong*[^jinong], but was later outcompeted by his younger brother, Temür. Subsequently, Darmabala and all of Kublai's descendants from that line dominated the selection of the Khagan and Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, completely sidelining Gammala and his son, Yesün Temür, from the competition. However, as Jinong, Gammala ruled the Mongolian steppes and the Gobi Desert, and he eternalized the greatness of Genghis Khan there through the Four Great Orders of Mongolia. After Gammala's death, Yesün Temür took over his position as Jinong. During the reigns of Khayishan, Ayurbarwada, and Shidibala, Yesün Temür, who owned vast lands in the north and had a strong military, became the most respected prince by the Great Assembly of Mongolia. His power as a leader on the steppes was unmatched by other Khans.

[^jinong]: Jinong or Jinwang (晉王) was a very high rank, which could be held by a Yuan Dynasty noble. Only those who had family ties with Kublai could hold this title.

"Hmm, how did the people of Zhongyuan react?" Duoluo Haoyu asked, closing his eyes on his couch. "Do they like this Yesün Temür?"

"Oh, it's very interesting," Douluo Jing said, laughing. "Initially, many people were hesitant because Yesün Temür's views clearly reeked of something foul — very fanatical about traditional Mongolian ways. But it turns out that, from the beginning of his enthronement, he showed respect to all Han officials and those who adhered to Confucian philosophy! The common people were then divided, and many praised him."

Douluo Haoyu laughed, "Clearly, because he ascended the throne through a *coup*!"

"According to Father, did he participate in that bloody coup?" Douluo Jing asked.

"That's for sure," his father replied. "You said, what was his name again—the official's name?"

"Daulat Shah," Douluo Jing answered. "He's a Muslim."

"Oh, right. This man must have a connection with Walus, Tegshi's envoy, who supposedly arrived late to inform Shidibala," Douluo Haoyu said, laughing again. "How could such a thing happen? Lying to a child!"

"Well, Father, you're mistaken," Douluo Jing countered. "Now, it turns out Tegshi, Esen Temur, and the others were all executed! Yesün Temür sent troops to Dadu and Shangdu to arrest officials he considered prone to rebellion against Shidibala."

"That's because he's afraid those people will make him a 'Puppet Emperor' next!" his father retorted. "Now tell me, what position has Daulat Shah been appointed to now?"

"He's been appointed Administrator of Political Affairs in the Zhongshu Sheng," Douluo Jing replied, a faint smile on his face, understanding his father's intent.

"See! What'd I tell you?" Douluo Haoyu said, opening his eyes and chuckling. "I bet now there are a lot of Muslims and Mongol officials from the Mongolian steppes holding power in the Zhongshu Sheng and other key positions, right? And conversely, I doubt many Han people are involved. If any are, they're probably given unimportant posts!"

Carefully examining his notes, Douluo Jing finally nodded. "Turns out you were right, Father!"

Suddenly, his father asked, "What about our king—that Wang To? Is he free?"

"No news," Douluo Jing answered, then muttered, "He should be... but there's no news yet..."

His father closed his eyes again, seemingly relieved. "Tell me when there is news."

Douluo Jing was about to say something else, but he saw his father's eyes were tightly closed, a sign he didn't want to be disturbed. "King Chungsuk is certainly important," he thought, "This must be because Father is worried about Shengniang." But to him, Wang To was most likely never coming back. Although Wang Ko's plan had failed, he had now married the daughter of the Yuan Dynasty's Prince of Liang and already held the title of King Shen of Yang (瀋王, Sim-yang Wang in Goryeo), a title previously held by King Chungseon, Wang To's father. This title had been granted to Chungseon for supporting Khayishan. Due to Wang Ko's machinations, King Chungseon was later exiled to Tibet, and Wang To himself was held hostage in Dadu, though treated well.

For Douluo Jing, the understanding of 'Wang' had changed after they joined the Yuan Dynasty. The character 'Wang' (王) was indeed understood as 'King' in Goryeo, but for the Yuan Dynasty, it was actually no more than a 'Prince'. As a result, the title 'King Shen of Yang' would be highly regarded by the people of Goryeo, equivalent to King Chungsuk himself, because it used the character 王, unlike 'Gun' (君), which was read 'Jun' in Han language!

At this point, Douluo Jing then wondered, what was the point of waiting for King Chungsuk? If Wang Ko returned, wouldn't they also have a king? If they wanted to help Ki Son-yeo, wouldn't it be more advantageous if Wang Ko returned here?

Thinking along these lines, he finally exhaled. This endless chess game was indeed exhausting, but for Shengniang's future, he simply had to play it.

Unfortunately, a few months later, the situation shifted again. He received news from his friends in Zhongyuan that Emperor Yesün Temür had decided to release Wang To. Wang To was currently preparing to return to Goryeo.

He immediately informed his father. "Father, King Chungsuk is on his way home. Isn't it time we spoke with Ki Ja-oh to cancel Shengniang's engagement?"

To his surprise, his father chuckled. "If you can, go right ahead. But I'd prefer if, from now on, you instruct Shengniang to memorize this..." His father then pulled out a book he had written himself from under his pillow.

Startled, Douluo Jing was about to ask a question, but then his eyes widened in astonishment. He exclaimed, "*Xianglong Shiba Zhang*[^xianglong-shiba-zhang]?" as he read the title of his father's book. "Father, isn't this... Great Hero Guo's martial art?"

"Indeed," his father replied. "You yourself didn't learn it. I saw no need for you to learn this art. But Shengniang is currently in a desperate situation. We must give her something as preparation that she can study later, once she's older. Her internal energy isn't strong enough yet."

Becoming confused, Douluo Jing asked, "Father, this..." Just then, his father coughed repeatedly. He immediately helped him ease his breathing. Lately, his father's health had been worsening as he approached ninety-five years old. He still hoped his father could reach a hundred, even though he knew his father always said that all humans would surely die, and that was the only thing certain in this world.

After his breathing improved, Douluo Haoyu said, "Don't delay. Tomorrow, you can begin teaching her all of this. In short, tell her to memorize everything. No need for immediate practice."

[^xianglong-shiba-zhang]: Xianglong Shi Ba Zhang (降龍十八掌), "18 Dragon Subduing Palm", is Kai Pang's signature move, passed down by Hong Qigong to Guo Jing. The same move was popularized by Kai Pang's much earlier master, Qiao Feng.

Douluo Jing would, of course, carry out his father's command, but he noticed this book had clearly been written by his father not long ago. He knew his father had inherited this martial art from Yelu Qi, before the Beggar's Sect leader died and his father fled to Goryeo. But such an art was generally not passed down casually to others, which was why he himself had never been taught it. Now his father was instructing him to read its contents to Ki Son-yeo, meaning he too would certainly be able to learn it. This implied his father intended to pass down this art more openly now.

As far as Douluo Jing knew, even Yang Guo, who could be considered a protector of the Beggar's Sect, didn't master this art! This meant his father saw something far more important at stake right now than merely saving Ki Son-yeo's life! He wondered to himself what his father was truly thinking.

Unfortunately, his father's continuously declining health meant he couldn't bear to ask further. The next day, he began reading the book aloud for Ki Son-yeo to memorize, and he himself started memorizing it as he read. As he did so, his mind also churned, searching for another way to cancel Ki Son-yeo's engagement to Wang Jeong.
