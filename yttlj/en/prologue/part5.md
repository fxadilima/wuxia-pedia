# Prologue
## *Henan, July 1327: The Little Fairy Finds a Sister*

*Add some information for English and Indonesian readers regarding chinese characters:*

She heard Tajkis say, "Ah, that's right! I almost forgot. Qi Shimei, from now on you can join us. This isn't official yet; I'll tell everything to Yang Jiaozhu later. But you don't need to worry, he'll definitely accept you. I suppose you'll also be in my group next." She smiled broadly, then warmly embraced Qi Shengniang, saying, "I hope you don't mind this kind of Jianghu life. Just consider it your destiny."

Qi Shengniang clapped her hands in delight. "How could I mind?" she said. "With you all, I don't have to be afraid anymore if I meet that bastard Wang Jeong and his guards!"

Yang Xiao asked, "Qi Shimei, why do you think that little prince wanted to capture you?"

"*Da Shige*[^da-shige], if I knew, I probably wouldn't have needed to flee here," Qi Shengniang replied sadly.

[^da-shige]: Da Shige (大師哥), "Eldest Martial Brother".

Suddenly, Fan Yao burst into laughter, then said, "Don't tell me you all still don't know? It's clear that little bastard fell in love with our Qi Shimei! That's not strange at all."

This simple joke surprisingly made Qi Shengniang's face flush, incomprehensibly to herself. For the second time, she felt her chest pound, because the one who said this was Fan Yao. However, Tajkis said, "I think that's true. But don't tease her anymore; our Qi Shimei is still too young. She doesn't understand such matters yet."

"I think Qi Shimei should keep wearing male clothes," Yang Xiao said. "That way, not everyone will easily recognize her. We also need to quickly find your two unruly disciples in Jiangnan. I'm worried they've run into trouble; it's been too long since they left us."

Suddenly, from a distance, they heard a woman's cry, "No need!" Then two young girls, about two years younger than Tajkis, emerged from behind the trees, leading three horses. "We saw you all in the town square earlier, but it was a bit hard to find you here."

"Mei Jian, Ah Luo!" Tajkis exclaimed happily. "You're back! What did you find?"

Both girls had distinct southern features, with wide, beautiful eyes. But one was tall, much taller than Tajkis, while the second, who was currently leading two horses, was of average Han woman height, but her figure was very beautiful despite her young age.

The tall girl bowed respectfully to Tajkis, greeting, "Mei Jian wishes to congratulate *Ah Jie*[^ah-jie], you've just found a new junior sister!" She grinned broadly, then said to Qi Shengniang, "Qi Shimei, your name fits perfectly as the youngest member of this group! We heard your conversation earlier."[^qi]

[^ah-jie]: Ah Jie (阿姐), basically the sama as Jiejie (姐姐), "Elder Sister" or "Big Sister".
[^qi]: Qi Shengniang surname is Qi (奇), also written the same in Hanja. The Hangul (기) not yet popular or even exists at the time. But it can sound similar to Qi (七), which is number 7.

"So the tall one is Mei Jian," Qi Shengniang thought. She greeted back with a respectful attitude, "Si Shijie (Fourth Senior Sister)!"

Mei Jian laughed, saying, "Qi Shimei, you're mistaken, I'm not the fourth sister, I'm only number six, one rank above you."

Ah Luo giggled, handing the horse reins she was holding to Qi Shengniang. "And I'm the fifth," she said. "Qi Shimei, you left your horse in the town square earlier. We brought it back for you."

Qi Shengniang was puzzled, never recalling owning a horse. "But I don't have a horse."

"Well, now you do," Ah Luo replied, her tone somewhat mysterious.

"How did you two know you'd be in positions five and six?" Tajkis said, laughing. "If we find someone younger than Qi Shimei next, that title itself will change."

"Ah Jie, that won't be necessary," Ah Luo said. Both of them were accustomed to calling Tajkis 'Ah Jie,' which was essentially the same as 'Jiejie,' or older sister. "Because we brought back the fourth sister."

She clapped her hands three times as a signal, and another girl, about the same age as Tajkis, appeared from behind the trees, leading her horse and smiling broadly.

"Susu!" Tajkis exclaimed in delight. "So you managed to bring her here!"

The girl warmly embraced Tajkis, then greeted Yang Xiao and Fan Yao, "Yin Susu greets *Da Shige*[^da-shige] and *Er Shige*[^er-shige]!" Then she looked at Qi Shengniang and said, "Qi Shimei, it's so good to meet you. So it was you who saved me from possibly being kidnapped by that prince."

[^er-shige]: Er Shiger (二師哥), "Second Martial Brother".
[^shijie]: Shijie (師姐), "Senior Martial Sister", as opposed to Shimei (師妹), which means "Junior Martial Sister". Just add the consecutive numbers respectively "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven", "yi er san si wu liu qi" (一二三四五六七) and we get, for example San Shijie (三師姐) for Tajkis, and Qi Shimei (七師妹) for Qi Shengniang.

[^shimei]: Shimei (師妹), "Junior Martial Sister".


Qi Shengniang could now see more clearly: this Yin Susu (殷素素) had a small, delicate face, snow-white skin, and wide, beautiful eyes typical of southern women, with long, curled eyelashes. Her crystal-clear irises seemed to tell stories just by looking at them. When she was happy, as she was at that moment, her beautiful eyes conveyed joy beyond the words she uttered. She spoke with a captivating intonation, akin to someone reading poetry. Her voice was not too high-pitched, so melodious and pleasant to the ear. Whether intentional or not, her choice of words tended to be poetic, feeling perfectly aligned with her appearance. Qi Shengniang couldn't find the right words to adequately describe Yin Susu.

If Tajkis weren't also there, in Qi Shengniang's eyes, this girl would be the most beautiful woman present. In contrast to the always-serious Tajkis, Yin Susu was like a cheerful little forest fairy. Just by looking at her, a sad person would feel comforted.

"Shengniang greets Fourth Sister," Qi Shengniang said, bowing respectfully. Suddenly, Tajkis rebuked her, "Qi Shimei (七師妹), from now on, never mention your full name in front of others. As we agreed earlier, even in front of others, we will only address each other as fellow martial siblings. You must get used to this as quickly as possible."

"This junior sister truly forgot," Qi Shengniang said, quickly. "This junior sister apologizes." Yin Susu laughed, embracing her and saying to Tajkis, "Shijie (師姐), don't be too harsh. She's still a child."

"*Da Xiaojie*[^da-xiaojie] suddenly becomes a Shimei," Yang Xiao remarked. "Have you asked your father for permission?"

[^da-xiaojie]: Da Xiaojie (大小姐). This term can be translated into something like "Young Lady of the house", refering to the most respected daughter of the master.

Tajkis snorted. "I think you are the one who objects to calling her 'Shimei'," she said. "Doesn't that demote your rank?"

"Tajkis — err, I mean San Shimei — it's quite difficult in this matter," Fan Yao said. "Imagine, if I suddenly called her 'Shimei', wouldn't that make her the junior martial sister of her own father?" He laughed, continuing, "Her father might even think I intend to propose to her."

Yin Susu blushed. At that time, she was nearly sixteen, and she could see that Fan Yao was very handsome. But she had always considered him a senior, though not on the same level as her own father, Yin Tianzheng. She knew that their leader had recently appointed Yang Xiao and Fan Yao as the Left and Right Emissaries, which put them on par with her father, or even higher. But in this situation, Fan Yao spoke very casually and freely, completely disregarding seniority or rank. This made everyone feel that what he had just suggested was very plausibly a real intention. Although she knew Fan Yao wasn't truly proposing, everyone burst into laughter.

Conversely, something stirred within Qi Shengniang's heart. For some reason, at this moment, she felt as if Yin Susu was her rival. She couldn't deny this feeling, nor could she explain its cause. Fortunately, this feeling didn't last long. As soon as this kind of conversation ended, she returned to feeling the previous warmth when speaking with Yin Susu.

Suddenly, Tajkis laughed and said, "If you're serious, I myself will speak to Yin *Qianbei* for you. But for now, you must first prove that you are worthy of it."

Yin Susu blushed even more, her face turning red as she said, "Shijie, he's just joking..."

Tajkis winked at her, then turned to Fan Yao and continued, "It's time the pirates in Jiangnan were taught a lesson. It's time for us to act. If your guts are too small to do it, then let the five of us go alone; you two wait here. Don't be afraid, I'll tell Yin Qianbei later that you also contributed to this."

Fan Yao felt his blood boil. He said, "Who says I'm scared?" He rolled up his sleeves. "Tell me, when do we leave?"

---

"Shidi (師弟)," Yang Xiao said, "I think we should have dinner first. There's a river nearby; we can go catch some fish, and the women can prepare them later."

He intended to discuss Tajkis's plan with Fan Yao, using this as an excuse to buy time. But before Fan Yao could even open his mouth, Tajkis said, "Tonight, we should all have dinner at the nearest tavern. I'll pay. It's almost dark, and I've been hungry for a while now."

Without waiting for Fan Yao's answer, she led the four other girls to the nearest tavern, leading their horses. However, before entering the tavern, Qi Shengniang and Yin Susu spotted Wang Jeong's entourage with his guards from a distance. To avoid unnecessary confrontation, Yang Xiao suggested finding another tavern. They headed north, arrived in Xinxiang (新鄉), and found a comfortable tavern where they could relax and have dinner.

The tavern was quite lively in the evening. They were performing a stage play, which was a very popular form of entertainment for common people at the time, enacting historical tales from ancient times. The story of Wang Mang's (王莽) rebellion was performed with a plot that struck Qi Shengniang as amusing. She had never witnessed such a play in Goryeo.

Noticing Qi Shengniang's keen interest, Fan Yao asked, "Qi Shimei (七師妹), do you know the story of this Wang Mang?"

"Shifu (師傅) once told me about it," Qi Shengniang replied, pleased that Fan Yao was paying attention. "It's just as they're telling it. According to Shifu, he was actually a rebel of the Han Dynasty."

"Actually?" Yang Xiao interjected. "He was truly a rebel! In this case, there's no 'actually'."

Tajkis clicked her tongue in annoyance. "Shige (師哥), you're disturbing our junior sister's viewing!"

Fan Yao grew curious and asked again, "What did your teacher say?"

"According to Shifu, even though he was a rebel, he was very kind to the common people," Qi Shengniang explained. "He abolished slavery and distributed land to the people, so Shifu couldn't call him evil."

"Wow, your teacher is very interesting," Fan Yao said, laughing. But he saw that Yang Xiao wasn't laughing, nor did he comment. "I'm curious, how does your teacher judge our current emperor?"


## *Xinxiang, July 1327: A Royal Revelation*

"Oh, about that, Shifu said the current emperor's kindness actually has a reason," Qi Shengniang replied, continuing to recount Douluo Jing's opinion, which was merely her Douluo Haoyu's views. "But as long as it's good for the people, why should we complain? Shifu said throughout history there's no ruler who is truly good."

"Ah!" Fan Yao said with a faint smile, "That means your teacher would also support General Bayan... I myself feel the same."

At this point, Yin Susu saw Yang Xiao's eyes light up, seemingly wanting to say something but then deciding against it. She remarked casually, "Actually, my father feels the same way, which is why I was sent to deliver something to General Bayan's residence."

"Aha!" Fan Yao exclaimed, "What is it?"

"Well, about that, I don't know myself," Yin Susu replied, laughing. "Father didn't say. Right now, Gege is in Jiangling. It seems related to this, but then again, maybe not."

"What's Yin Yewang doing there?" Yang Xiao asked, curious.

Tajkis laughed coldly. "Southern girls are indeed beautiful," she said. "Gathering new 'managers' for his gambling dens there, I suppose."

Ah Luo and Mei Jian laughed at the comment. They knew that at just eighteen years old, Yin Yewang already had a collection of many girls he sometimes brought home, even though he had just recently married and was awaiting the birth of his child.

Yin Susu knew Tajkis never liked her brother. She merely offered a thin smile, not commenting on Tajkis's sarcasm. Instead, she cleared her throat, stating concisely, "There, father is holding an art exhibition. Someone will be attending." She motioned for them all to lean closer and lowered her voice, "You must have heard the name Tugh Temür..."

Yang Xiao offered a faint smile. "That's something," he murmured, "but what about his brother, the one in the north?"

"Well, I don't know about that," Yin Susu said again. "According to father, Tugh Temür is surrounded by Han officials."

"Kusala is in the north; I think he'll be the same," Fan Yao mused, muttering, "I have a bad feeling. This is a bad omen... if these two then come into conflict, great chaos will ensue..."

Yang Xiao stated, "That's precisely what's good."

All eyes turned to him, filled with questions. "What's good about it?" Tajkis asked, her brow furrowed. "What will happen then is *war*! Are you ignorant, or just pretending to be? Right now, the Yuan Dynasty has started using extremely powerful cannons! The ones who will truly suffer are the *innocent common people*!"

All eyes turned to him, filled with questions. "What's good about it?" Tajkis asked, her brow furrowed. "What will happen then is war! Are you ignorant, or just pretending to be? Right now, the Yuan Dynasty has started using extremely powerful cannons! The ones who will truly suffer are the innocent common people!"

Hearing "innocent common people," Qi Shengniang suddenly remembered something she had long wanted to ask, but because she had only just met Yang Xiao, she hadn't dared. Now, after Tajkis's remark, she plucked up the courage to ask, "Da Shige, who actually killed the family in Kaifeng at that time? Were our people really involved? Who is Cheng Kun?"

Yang Xiao, Fan Yao, and Tajkis were greatly surprised to hear her question. Meanwhile, Yin Susu, Ah Luo, and Mei Jian grew curious. They knew nothing about this matter. "Killed a family in Kaifeng?" Yin Susu asked. "I was there too, why didn't I know?"

"Perhaps Shijie was busy with her delivery task then," Qi Shengniang said, "or perhaps because she had to deal with Wang Jeong's people. That's why Shijie didn't know." She turned back to Yang Xiao, her tone more urgent, "Da Shige, were our people truly involved?"

Yang Xiao let out a long sigh, speaking with regret. "This Cheng Kun is actually the teacher of Jin Mao Shi Wang, Xie Xun. I myself have never met him, but it seems Xie Xun himself is hard to find these days. Frankly, I'm also a bit uncertain about this. Xie Xun's temperament is unpredictable."

"So Cheng Kun has also disappeared?" Ah Luo asked, growing equally curious.

"It seems so," Yang Xiao replied. "But I still don't understand what all of this has to do with Xie Xun."

"Someone mentioned another similar incident happened in Sichuan," Qi Shengniang said, "Then the Kongtong Pai people said the victims there were killed with Qi Shang Quan. This... what's the connection?" Qi Shengniang pressed again.

"That's even stranger," Fan Yao said, "because I know Xie Xun stole that manual from Kongtong Pai. But why would he kill so many people?"

Tajkis sighed, saying with regret, "Actually, I also sent Yue Sanguo to investigate this matter. I heard from another Five-Element Banner member that Xie Xun (謝遜) was heading to Shangdu (上都) from Sichuan. Unexpectedly, an incident like this has now occurred in Kaifeng. Now..."

At that moment, from outside the tavern, a man dressed as a farmer appeared, immediately approaching their table to speak to Tajkis. "Xiaojie (小姐), a similar incident has happened in Shangdu—we just received news from Yue Sanguo's envoy."

"Hm!" Tajkis said, turning to her fellow sect members, then back to the man, "Where is Yue Sanguo himself now?"

"Still near the scene of the incident, in Shangdu," his subordinate replied.

"Alright, return to your original post!"

Fan Yao rose to his feet, stating firmly, "It cannot be delayed any longer. Our reputation will be ruined if this is left unaddressed. We're going to Shangdu right now!"


## *Hebei, August 1327: A Spreading Shadow*

Departing that very night, they only rested in Guangpinglu before continuing north, pausing for rest at the edges of forests along the way. Two days later, they arrived in Baodinglu, where they were met by another horseman. He approached Tajkis with startling news: "Xiaojie, a similar incident just occurred in Dadu, and before that, in Zhangjiakou too!"

"What?!" Tajkis exclaimed, furious. "That fast?"

Fan Yao stated, "Looking at the sequence of events, from Kaifeng, he went to Shangdu, then Zhangjiakou, and now Dadu. This means he's heading south! We should intercept him here."

But Qi Shengniang spoke up, "Er Shige, from Dadu he could go anywhere. What if he immediately takes a ship in another direction, or goes west?"

Tajkis, Yin Susu, Ah Luo, and Mei Jian exchanged glances. They secretly admired Qi Shengniang's quick thinking. "You're right," Tajkis said. "That means we have to split up, at least to gather information. If you encounter anything, don't act rashly—leave a mark! We'll use the Ming Cult's flame symbol, and it can serve as an arrow pointing the direction we're heading."

"Good," Yang Xiao said. "In that case, I will take two others north. In Dadu, we'll split further. Shidi, you take four others and spread out around here! We'll meet back here in two days."

---

While Fan Yao and Qi Shengniang , along with all the other girls, spread out around Baodinglu, Yang Xiao, Tajkis, and the messenger headed towards Dadu. The next day, just before noon, they arrived at Dadu's south gate. Yang Xiao dismounted his horse and tied it to a tree about one *li* from the gate. "We're forbidden to ride horses here. Best not to look for trouble."

As a Persian descendant, Tajkis didn't feel bound by rules forbidding horse riding or carrying weapons, but this time she obeyed Yang Xiao without argument. They also left their swords behind, concealing them in the bushes near where their horses were tied.

Just as they were about to step through the gate, another horseman arrived from the east, approaching the Five-Element Banner member who was with them. "Baasan," he said, "not far from the last incident, three more houses have been struck!"

Baasan, Yang Xiao, and Tajkis stared in stunned silence for two seconds. "His trail leads west from the last house I reported," Baasan's comrade continued. "It seems the killer fled towards Shuozhou (朔州)."

Yang Xiao said, "You, inform all this to Fan Youshi in Baoding. Tell them to head to Shuozhou immediately!"

After the man left, he turned to Tajkis and Baasan. "Let's go to the west gate; it's sure to be crowded there!"

His prediction was correct. Not far from the gate, two large houses, apparently belonging to Yuan Dynasty officials, were swarming with curious onlookers. Peering into the houses, Tajkis and Yang Xiao found a scene almost identical to what they had seen in Kaifeng. It appeared that the entire household of both families had been killed, not a single servant left alive. But they found no writing on the walls, unlike in Kaifeng.

"Strange," Tajkis said, her brow furrowed. "Why didn't he leave a mark this time?"

One of the onlookers answered her question, "According to the tavern owner across the street, the killer approached these two houses shouting like a madman! After finishing everyone off, he just left."

Startled, exchanging glances with his two companions, Yang Xiao then asked, "What did he say?"

"It seemed... '*Cheng Kun, return my family! Cheng Kun*...' he kept repeating that name..." the man replied.

"Ah!" Yang Xiao and Tajkis exclaimed almost simultaneously. The three immediately departed the spot, exiting the city gate.

"We'll follow him west now, ignore that place," Tajkis said. "This is clearly Xie Xun! After practicing the Qi Shang Quan (七傷拳) he stole, he sometimes goes crazy like this."


## *Baodinglu, August 1327: A Chase and a Revelation*

In Baodinglu (保定路), Fan Yao (范遥) decided to investigate the killer's trail westward with Qi Shengniang (奇聖娘), whom he considered the weakest. He sent Ah Luo (阿萝) and Mei Jian (梅劍) eastward, while Yin Susu (殷素素) was to remain in place, watching for possibilities from the north.

Spending the night on the edge of a forest, on their way to Xiurong (秀榮), Qi Shengniang still managed to ask before her eyes closed, "Er Shige (二師哥), why does it seem like we're now hostile towards the Kai Pang (丐幫), weren't they very meritorious in the past?"

"Hm!" Fan Yao replied, "After Yelu Qi's (耶律齊) passing, the members of the Kai Pang are now nothing more than bandits who only cause trouble, extorting money from residents, demanding protection fees, and such. Of course, many people are hostile towards them. Why do you ask?"

"Because Shifu (師傅) used to be a member of the Kai Pang," Qi Shengniang answered frankly. "He was actually Yelu Qi's disciple."

"Oh, no wonder your kung fu is good," Fan Yao said, grinning broadly. "Alright, we need to continue our journey early in the morning. You rest now."

The small compliment greatly pleased Qi Shengniang. She fell asleep under a tree, across from where Fan Yao sat cross-legged, a faint smile playing on her lips.

It felt like she had only slept for a moment when she felt her shoulder being shaken. Faintly, she heard, "Qi Shimei (七師妹), Qi Shimei, wake up... someone's heading south!"

Opening her eyes, she saw Fan Yao's face before her. For just a second she was confused, then realized she was on the edge of a forest, and the sun was beginning to peek over the eastern horizon. Leaping to her feet, she hurried to follow Fan Yao, mounting her own horse. "Follow me!" Fan Yao shouted, spurring his horse southwest.

Not long after, they saw a man in his forties, dressed in coarse clothes, running at high speed using his qinggong (輕功). Fan Yao shouted, "Hey, don't run!"

But instead of stopping, the man increased his speed, darting like the wind with the intention of entering the forest. Qi Shengniang grabbed her bow and arrows, swiftly aiming and releasing an arrow. The man apparently noticed the arrow approaching him. He nimbly dodged to the left while continuing his run without looking back. Qi Shengniang's arrow grazed his right shoulder. He shrieked, "Ah!" but continued running.

Successively, Qi Shengniang released seven arrows. Only two of them managed to lightly injure his left leg and right arm, merely grazing him.

Once he was sure he could close the distance, Fan Yao leaped towards the man from his horse's back, extending his right palm, releasing a strike imbued with internal energy. The man evidently heard the sharp whooshing sound behind his back that accompanied Fan Yao's strike. He leaped high towards a tree to evade.

Qi Shengniang, seeing the movement from behind, immediately jumped from her horse's back towards the targeted tree, her long sword drawn in her right hand, executing Yue Nu Jian Fa (越女劍法) with graceful movements. Surprised, the man they were chasing did not seem afraid. He turned after landing lightly on a tree branch, extending his right hand with two fingers forward to pinch the side of Qi Shengniang's sword, while his left hand simultaneously aimed for an acupuncture point on the little girl's left back shoulder. If his pinch on Qi Shengniang's sword succeeded, her body would be pulled forward, leaving the left side of her back exposed, and her left shoulder would be immediately struck.

However, after missing his target, Fan Yao quickly pursued to the right. Seeing his opponent's intention, he immediately kicked a pebble in front of him towards the opponent's right hand. At the same time, he darted forward, with an open palm aiming for the man's back.

Qi Shengniang realized her opponent's intent, and also saw the strength of this man's fingers. She immediately rotated her sword-wielding wrist, and the pinch missed. Instead, the sword tip now aimed for her opponent's throat as he lunged forward. The man was greatly surprised, not expecting the little girl in front of him to be capable of this movement. He dodged by tilting his head to the left, simultaneously avoiding Fan Yao's attack. He shouted loudly, "Stop! I don't know you, why are you attacking me?"

Fan Yao (范遥) laughed, glancing at his opponent's appearance, and said in a flat tone, "Your movements are suspicious, and there are bloodstains on your clothes. We just heard about a major massacre in the north. Where are you going?"

Not to be outdone, the man burst into laughter, answering lightly, "I just killed a wild boar and ate it. Conversely, who are you? Aren't you clearly Han people, trying to arrest me?"

"Tell me your name first, then I can decide whether to arrest you or not," Fan Yao said casually. He seemed inclined to be friendly. "We are clearly not government officials, but rendering a small service to the government is not wrong. That killer clearly disturbs the people, making them fearful."

"Haha! Alright, my name is Zeng Akun (曾阿昆)," the man replied carelessly. "Now tell me, what do you want?"

Qi Shengniang (奇聖娘) thought, "Zeng Akun (曾阿昆) — isn't that Cheng Kun (成昆)?" She turned to Fan Yao, who happened to be looking at her meaningfully. "Er Shige (二師哥), this Shushu's (叔叔) name sounds similar to the killer's name written on the wall of that house in Kaifeng."

The man burst into laughter. "You actually believe such a thing? Who kills people and then boldly inscribes their name on house walls? I won't hide it anymore; I am indeed Cheng Kun (成昆)! Do you truly think I killed that many people? Go find that madman; stop bothering me!" He turned, intending to leave using his qinggong.

But Fan Yao (范遥) acted swiftly. "Hey! Wait a moment!" He leaped forward, aiming to seize Cheng Kun's wrist to apprehend him. Unexpectedly, Cheng Kun spun around and met the grab with his index and middle fingers pointed towards Fan Yao's chest. A sharp wind preceded his attack. "Whoa!" Fan Yao cried in surprise, dodging by shifting his right foot half a circle backward. But Cheng Kun's continuously lunging fingers were now aimed directly at Qi Shengniang (奇聖娘), who stood behind Fan Yao! Realizing this too late, Fan Yao shouted, "Shimei (師妹), look out!"

Sensing danger, Qi Shengniang instinctively moved her sword to cut at Cheng Kun's extended arm. However, Cheng Kun moved swiftly past her without retracting his right hand. Instead, he was now behind Qi Shengniang. He channeled his internal energy to strike the girl's back with his left palm.

Cheng Kun's (成昆) movement caused Qi Shengniang's (奇聖娘) strike to miss him, though Cheng Kun didn't seem to withdraw his right hand. Instead, she now heard a sharp whoosh from behind. She bent her knees while twisting her wrist to the right, then bent her waist backward. The situation quickly reversed. Now her sword tip was aimed directly at her opponent's lower abdomen, while Cheng Kun's palm strike hit only air.

It never occurred to Qi Shengniang that Cheng Kun's right hand, which he had kept to protect his abdomen, had now firmly gripped her sword. The sword's momentum halted just before penetrating Cheng Kun's stomach. Qi Shengniang pulled her sword with all her might while turning to face her opponent, launching a left palm strike towards Cheng Kun's head.

Just then, Fan Yao (范遥) shouted, "Look out!" but it was too late. After releasing his grip on Qi Shengniang's sword, which she was pulling back, Cheng Kun shifted his attack into another palm strike, straight forward, aimed precisely at the little girl's palm that was trying to strike him.

As Qi Shengniang's palm met her opponent's, her small body flew backward like a snapped kite. She shrieked, "Ah!"

Fan Yao rushed to catch her, preventing Qi Shengniang's body from violently hitting a tree about five meters behind her. Qi Shengniang's small body landed lightly in his arms, but Cheng Kun used the opportunity to leap away, using his qinggong, disappearing into the forest. Fan Yao ignored him, looking at the instantly unconscious Qi Shengniang, her palm feeling as if stung by lightning.

Fan Yao hurriedly checked Qi Shengniang's heartbeat and felt immense relief to find the little girl was still breathing. He swiftly carried Qi Shengniang onto his horse and then spurred the horse back towards Baodinglu (保定路).

## *Shuozhou, August 1327: The Golden-Haired Lion King*

Meanwhile, in Shuozhou (朔州), Yang Xiao (杨逍), Tajkis (黛綺絲), and Baatar (巴桑), having just arrived at the city's outer perimeter, immediately spotted a tall, large man with long, disheveled hair. He was running westward with the speed of wind, shouting, "Cheng Kun (成昆), return my son! Return my wife! Bastard! Cheng Kun...!"

Instead of entering Shuozhou, the three immediately gave chase westward. "That's Xie Xun (謝遜)!" Yang Xiao exclaimed, spurring his horse onward. "Baatar, inform Fan Youshi (范右使)—Xie Xun appears to be heading back to Guangming Ding (光明頂). Tell them to head directly west!"

Baatar turned his horse back towards Baodinglu (保定路), while Yang Xiao and Tajkis continued their pursuit of Xie Xun.

"Shige (師兄), he'll surely collapse soon," Tajkis (黛綺絲) called out, as they continued to spur their horses westward as fast as possible. "I've seen him like this before at Guangming Ding (光明頂). After he passes out, he'll return to normal."

"Hm! But we must prevent him from harming more people," Yang Xiao (杨逍) replied.

Tajkis's guess was right. After running for about ten li (里), Xie Xun (謝遜) stopped, looking bewildered. Then he let out a loud cry and collapsed to the ground. They immediately dismounted to help him lean against a shady tree. Tajkis fetched water from a nearby stream to give him a drink, while Yang Xiao opened Xie Xun's mouth so the fresh water could enter his throat. A gentle breeze helped to refresh the Ming Cult warrior.

About ten minutes later, Xie Xun opened his eyes, confused, seemingly completely unaware of what had happened. Seeing Yang Xiao and Tajkis, he asked, "Why are you here? Where is this?"

"This is near Shuozhou (朔州)," Tajkis replied, offering more water for Xie Xun to drink; her clothes were still damp with sweat. "Xie Daxia (謝大俠), you may not realize it, but you just killed several families in Shangdu, Zhangjiakou, and also Dadu..." She couldn't bring herself to finish the sentence.

"What?" Xie Xun exclaimed, clearly shocked. "How... what... My God! Why am I like this?"

Yang Xiao, staring intently at him, asked, "Xie Dage (謝大哥), what's the last thing you remember—just before this?"

Xie Xun's brow furrowed, a sign he was thinking very hard, trying to recall the last thing he did. "I saw that bastard—Cheng Kun (成昆)! After that, I went crazy, and then everything became unclear..."

Hearing this, Yang Xiao (杨逍) quickly racked his brain. Xie Xun (謝遜), no matter what, could not be left roaming the Central Plains. Regardless of whether he should be judged guilty or not, he had to be brought back to Guangming Ding (光明頂) immediately. Turning to Tajkis (黛綺絲), he said, "Tajkis, return to Baoding (保定) at once. Tell Er Shidi (二師弟) to meet us at Guangming Ding without delay. I will accompany Xie Dage (謝大哥) ahead of you."

Assessing the situation, Tajkis immediately mounted her horse to find Fan Yao (范遥) without further argument. Meanwhile, Yang Xiao tried to calm Xie Xun. "Xie Dage, for now, it's best you don't appear in the Central Plains. Everyone will be looking for you to account for what has happened. We will consult Yang Jiaozhu (陽教主) on how to resolve this matter."
