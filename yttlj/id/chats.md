# Menyembelih Naga, Melakukan Kehendak Surga

Bagian ini adalah 'Buku 1' dari karya besar Jin Yong — *Yitian Tulong Ji* (倚天屠龍記), yang saya tulis ulang, dengan lebih mengandalkan akurasi dengan peristiwa sejarah, meskipun masih berusaha mempertahankan semangat nuansa aslinya.

Seperti yang dijabarkan dalam [README di bagian awal](../../README.md), penelitian saya memang bermula dari 'Jilid 34' versi bahasa Inggris hasil terjemahan *fans* tersebut, tepatnya pada titik di mana Zhang Wuji dan Zhao Min kecil berjumpa dengan Chaghan Temur — ayah kandung Zhao Min. Tetapi saya juga memasukkan elemen lain yang sama sekali tidak dibahas di dalam karya Jin Yong. Hal ini akhirnya membuat saya memutuskan untuk menulis ulang semuanya sekaligus, karena sangat sulit menyusun narasi dengan hanya menyelipkan elemen-elemen terkait dengan inti cerita.

*Prolog* dalam karya asli Jin Yong sangat panjang, dan sebagian besar menceritakan tentang pertemuan Zhang Sanfeng muda dengan Yang Guo, membuat cerita ini tersambung ke Trilogi kedua dalam cerita asli Jin Yong. Tetapi sebenarnya narasi cukup berat itu tak banyak diceritakan lagi dalam perkembangan. Saya memakai bagian *prolog* untuk menceritakan latar belangan lain, yang boleh dikatakan tidak dibahas dalam karya asli Jin Yong, yaitu tentang seorang anak perempuan kecil, dilahirkan di Haengju pada tahun 1315, yang akhirnya akan menjadi Permaisuri Qi — pribadi yang wajib diceritakan dalam kisah tentang era akhir Dinasti Yuan.

If in 1341 (counting from Zhang Wuji'a 9 years old age, as we made him born in 1332), Zhang Sanfeng was celebrating his 100 years old birthday, then we can safely assume (or invent) his birthyear is around 1241.

According to Jin Yong, when Zhang Sanfeng was around 13, he was encountered Yang Guo, Xiao Longnu and also 16 or 17 years old Guo Xiang. This means, that year *must* be 1254. But, again, Jin Yong was inaccurate (either deliberately or not). Because at the time, he also wrote Yang Guo has already kill Mongke Khan, while Mongke Khan, historically, died on 1259.

This give us several choices:

1. Using Zhang Sanfeng's birthday as the base to calculate events.
2. Using Mongke Khan's death as the base.

Or we can use both, thus, yields:

- Zhang Sanfeng should be around 20 when he met Guo Xiang.
- Since this event was a side story anyway, then we can replace it all together, to slightly implicate Guo Xiang and also her parents — as the original creators of Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao (mandatory).

---

*Maintaining Character Connections: If Zhang Sanfeng was 13 when he met Yang Guo and Guo Xiang, and Yang Guo had already killed Mongke Khan (1259), then Zhang Sanfeng would have to be born in 1246. This means he'd be 95 in 1341, not 100.*
- Unfortunately, this cannot be done, due to some events in Jin Yong's narrative *is also mandatory*. In Zhnag Sanfeng's 100 years celebration, these events occored:
    
    1. Tragic death of Zhang Wuji's parents, voluntarily suicide because unwilling to say Xie Xun's whereabout.
    2. All 6 major sects come to Wudang, under the pretext to celebrate Zhang Sanfeng's 100 years, albeit false. They just want to pressed Zhang Cuishan to say where his sworn brother is.
    
    This is why it cannot be adjusted.

---

Well, I have another idea. Since we want to rewrite the whole story anyway, and the meeting of Zhang Sanfeng and Guo Xiang is now (in the timeframe of Yitian Tulong Ji) a *legend*, then we, in order to *humanized* those legend, can have *Zhang Sanfeng himself* tell the story (which some readers would love to read) that he met Guo Xiang at his 20s! We can remove or *blur the previous meeting* exact years. Zhang Sanfeng (at the time was Zhang Junbao)'s personal story is not so clear anyway. We can have *this* Zhang Sanfeng wonder, what if he have a chance know Guo Xiang (who actually a few years his senior) a bit longer?

Meanwhile, our 5 years old (would later on be) Empress Qi was sill in Haengju, her hometown, listening her old martial arts master (about 90 years old at the time). He was originally from Zhongyuan, runaway to Goryeo after Xiangyang fall and Guo Jing died. So, this master is equally important of the historical source (albeit he is a fictional character). As he — Duoluo Haoyu — was born 1230 (actually older than Zhang Sanfeng, if still alive). Qi Shengniang (future Empress Qi), lost her dearest teacher when she was around 11. Douluo Haoyu, onece learned from Yelu Qi, after Guo Jing and Huang Rong died, and later on, after Yelu Qi also died, he becomes a formidable hero. This is why Qi Shengniang knew about 18 Dragon Subduing Palm technique, and also Yue Nu Jian Fa from Han Xiaoying.

---

By this time he already showed a wide range of scholarly and artistic interests and had surrounded himself with many distinguished Chinese literati and artists. As the persecuted sons of Khayishan Külüg Khan, Tugh Temür and Kusala still enjoyed a measure of sympathy among the Borjigin princes and, more importantly, the lingering loyalty of some of their father's followers who had survived various political purges.

**Ideas for Further Development:**

1. Duoluo Haoyu's Past (Subtly): While his background as an eight-pouch Beggars' Sect elder and his connection to Yelu Qi (and thus Guo Jing/Huang Rong) is explicitly stated in your notes, consider how to subtly hint at this in the narrative itself, perhaps through a brief internal thought from Haoyu, or a comment he makes. This isn't necessary immediately, but something to keep in mind for his eventual detailed backstory. For example, he might observe the officer's rough demeanor and mentally compare it to the discipline (or lack thereof) he saw in his Beggars' Sect days.

2. Ki Ja-oh's Observation: You mentioned that "Ki Ja-oh ... discovered that Duoluo Haoyu is a high-level martial arts expert." The current scene shows Haoyu's subtle intervention. Perhaps Ki Ja-oh or one of his men was among the onlookers and specifically noticed Haoyu's swift, almost invisible movement. This could be a good point to show how his abilities were discovered, rather than just stating it. For instance, the man who saw Haoyu move could be working for Ki Ja-oh.

3. Ki Son-yeo's Reaction to the Market Incident: While her attention is on her teacher, what is her five-year-old perspective of this small skirmish? Does she show fear, curiosity, or a tiny spark of admiration for her teacher's unseen intervention? This could further establish her character traits early on. Perhaps she just notices the officer stumble and looks at her teacher with innocent wonder.

4. The "Holy Maiden" Name: You've explained the meaning of "Qi Shengniang" in a footnote, but within the narrative, could there be a brief, tender moment where Duoluo Haoyu explains why he gave her that name? This would deepen their bond and foreshadow her future importance. It could be something as simple as him saying, "Because you have a pure spirit, like a little Holy Maiden," or "You have the potential to bring righteousness to the world, my little Shengniang."

Beside El Temur, another powerful charismatic figure in 1327 is [Bayan of Merkid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayan_of_the_Merkid).

Some notable quote found in Wikipedia is this:

"During the reign of Külüg Khan (Emperor Wuzong of Yuan), Bayan was appointed to a number of positions in the court. He became a Darughachi in 1309, and then held several provincial posts during the reign of Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan (Emperor Renzong of Yuan), namely the Tong Pingzhangshi (vaguely, the "vice prime minister") of Jiangzhe province, Jiangxi province and Henan province. It is said that he did not tolerate any local bullies who took advantage of the poor."

*It give us*:

1. Most likely, Han people in Kaifeng or the entire Henan at that time tends to like Bayan.
2. Although, he also opposed Yesun Temur reign (secretly), due to his loyalty to Khayishan.
3. At this point, Bayan has not yet act ruthlessly against a number of Han people.
4. Thus, the people in Henan, or specifically Kaifeng, have no tendencies to rebel!

**Another point:**

- Both Chaghan Temur and Zhu Yuanzhang has not yet even born at this moment, much less Cheng Youliang, even more unlikely Zhang Wuji :D (the name 'Susu' is actually refers to his mother, and the youngster seen by Ki Son-yeo earlier was his maternal uncle, Yin Yewang)
- Peng Yingyu has not proclaims his own version of Ming Jiao teaching, which would led to the rise of Hongjin Qiyi.

But, Ki Son-yeo does not aware, during the Yuan Dynasty, Han Chinese were strictly forbidden from carrying weapons. This policy was part of a broader system of social control and classification aimed at ensuring the Mongol rulers' authority and preventing uprisings. Han Chinese were also restricted from riding horses, speaking the Mongol language, and intermarrying with Mongols. 

**Here's a more detailed explanation:**

- *Control and Identification:*
  The Yuan Dynasty's class system, with the Han Chinese at the bottom, was a tool for control. By forbidding weapons, congregating, and other activities, the rulers could easily identify and monitor the Han Chinese population. 

- *Military Registers*:
  While Han Chinese were generally forbidden from possessing weapons, those on military registers could be issued weapons when needed for military campaigns, but were required to return them upon completion. 

- *Preventing Uprisings*:
  The restrictions on Han Chinese, including the ban on weapons, were designed to prevent them from forming rebellions or engaging in organized resistance against the Mongol rulers. 

- *Beyond Racial Motivation*:
  While the ban on weapons was partly motivated by racial differences, the primary aim was to maintain social order and control over the Han Chinese population, which made up a significant portion of the empire. 

- Other Restrictions:
  The Han Chinese were also prohibited from riding horses, speaking Mongol, and intermarrying with Mongols, further reinforcing their subordinate status within the Yuan social structure.

In my previously written narrative, in the prologue, the young Ki Son-yeo enters Shangdu in 1328, during a chaos, caused by the sudden death of Emperor Yesun Temur. But now, although it was quite compeling, let us make it better. Make Yin Tianzheng actually supports the El Temur and General Bayan, who he see as a potential help for the common Han people, especially because Tugh Temur's strong confucian oriented and Han oriented alliances.

---

The previously mentioned misson of 'Xiaojie' (actually, Yin Susu) to Henan, is nonetheless to escort gifts for General Bayan, who actually (historically) is Toqto'a's uncle. Toqto's himself, currently is under his uncle's guidance, from military's side. But his own father has a very different political stance than Bayan (more Confucianist and Han oriented). While Yin Susu do her duty and go to Henan, Yin Yewang also do similar duty, approaching **Tugh Temur**, who currently live in Jiangling.

Jin Yong, somewhat simplified his narrative, not telling what actually happened in Guangming Ding during these period, and simply mentioned this via Xie Xun and Tajkis's story much later on, when retelling their own backstories. In this case, Jin Yong's version, thus, also simplified the intricate political alliances and power plays within the Yuan court. He said, at some point, that Yang Dingtian was really meant to rebel early on. But, seeing the current emperor's stance and common people's sentiments, can he, as a Ming Jiao's leader and regious motivator, spiritual leader, really rebel, saying 'this is for the sake of common people'? I guess he definately cannot!

Ming Jiao, as a spiritual movement, *concern for the well-being of common people*, yes! But it is not the same as rebel against the effective government! Yang Dingtian might be willing to act more actively, unlike those other religion groups, Shaolin or Wudang, who will tend to avoid 'worldly matters' and live in seclutions, but Yang Dingtian still would not encourage people to rebel! Not even Mani himself would do such thing! Mani also being persecuted, probably as rebel, but I personaly doubt that he actually rebelled against Persian government.

---

*It suggests a phase of strategic engagement and perhaps even observation, before the later, more overt "Red Turban" rebellions.*
- Historically, Ming Jiao itself, *never* suggest any kind of rebellions, but it was **Peng Yingyu**, the one who teach a version of Ming Jiao's doctrine about Mingwang, and then interpreted by common people as something else. Apparently, whether in real history or just in this story, Peng Yingyu was deliberately allow such interpretation, that would eventually lead to wide-spread rebellion, and Hongjin Qiyi was born (his movement, the red headband).

---

- Ki Son-yeo's first meeting with Ming Jiao's official will be Tajkis, Yang Xiao and Fan Yao.
- Although Yin Yewang and Yin Susu are also a Ming Jiao's disciple, but their membership were merely due to their identities as Yin Tianzheng's children. They know absolutely *nothing* about Ming jiao's teaching, except those related to physical experiences, like not eating meat or drinking wine.
- Real Manichaeism teaching, while not explicitly *prohibit* marriage, but explicitly stated that sexual activities are sins. So, in practice, *only* those of the high priests of Ming Jiao live in celibate. Even Yin Tianzheng or Yang Dingtian himself does not. We can see this as the secular life of their followers, known as 'the hearers', as compared to celibate lives of their 'Bishops' and monks, like in any other religions. Buddhist folowers also eat meat, while a monk does not. A buddhist believers can married, but no for buddhist nuns or monks. St. Agustine was also the followers, before converted to Christianity, but he consider himself as 'just a hearer'. He even has a concubine, who give him a son.
- Commonly, in Jin Yong's world, Ming Jiao was also called 'Mo Jiao', which means 'Demonic Teachings', while the original name was 'Moni Jiao'. We simply write bot versions, as the following continuation text:

Untuk sementara kita mematok tahun kelahiran Xie Xun di sekitar 1285:

- Sekitar tahun 1327, ia berusia sekitar 45 tahun. Membuatnya punya anak sekitar umur 27 tahun. Anaknya mati dibanting Cheng Kun ketika masih bayi. Menurut cerita Xie Xun sendiri, jika masih hidup, anak itu pasti sudah berusia sekitar 18 tahun, ketika menjelang/setelah Zhang Wuji dilahirkan (1332). (Bab 7, page 21).

**Cabai jawa (Piper retrofractum Vahl)**

In Chapter 7 of the original Jin Yong's narrative, we can find Xie Xun said that his son, if still alive, would be 18 years old now (that was just after Zhang Wuji was born, we make Zhang Wuji born in 1332). Thus, he was born around 1314, almost the same as Ki Son-yeo and Toqto'a.

For years, Xie Xun has been trying to take revenge to Cheng Kun, who murder his family, but did not succeed, because Cheng Kun was already hide in Shaolin Temple, under the name Yuanzhen Dashi, as a monk!

Jin Yong tell the story via another characters, but we can insert them here:

The following sub-plot found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Heaven_Sword_and_Dragon_Saber_characters#Emei_School

*Guhongzi (孤鴻子; Gūhóngzǐ) was Miejue's senior who challenged Yang Xiao to a duel. He borrowed Miejue's Heaven-Reliant Sword in the hope that it would give him an advantage. However, he lost to Yang Xiao and the sword was seized from him by Yang before he could even unsheathe it. Yang Xiao made some unkind remarks, threw the sword to the ground and walked away. Guhongzi felt disgraced and insulted and eventually died in frustration. His death caused Miejue to bear a grudge against Yang Xiao and the Ming Cult.*

---

*Miejue's Prioritization: Her dismissive reaction to Cheng Kun's message makes more sense. While Cheng Kun is a murderer, Miejue's primary obsession is with avenging Guhongzi and "eradicating" the Ming Cult, whom she considers the true demonic force.*
- This Guhongzi story is yet to happen. Let's make it happen now, right before Ki Son-yeo's eyes:

**Qianlong Wu Yong:**

In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged, dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative forces on earth begin to stir again.

Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time will fulfill itself. One need not fear lest strong will should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is not yet ripe.

**Facts about Kusala:**

Khutughtu Khan (; Mongolian script: ; 忽都篤汗), born Kuśala (Mongolian: Хүслэн ; 和世剌; , meaning "virtuous"/"wholesome"), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Mingzong of Yuan (元明宗; 22 December 1300 – 30 August 1329), was a son of Khayishan (Emperor Wuzong) who seized the throne of the Yuan dynasty of China in 1329, but died in suspicious circumstances six months later. Apart from the Emperor of China, he is considered as the 13th Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire.

Yuan Dynasty official architecture, while influenced by earlier styles, also saw unique developments under Mongol rule. The most prominent example is *Yongle Palace*, a large Taoist complex, which showcases the period's architectural characteristics. These include the use of *double-eaved Xie-shan style roofs*, glazed tiles for decoration, and a focus on symmetrical layouts in palace buildings. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Influences and Innovations:**
Yuan Dynasty architecture incorporated elements from the preceding Jin Dynasty, but also reflected Mongol preferences and building practices. 

**Yongle Palace:**
This significant site, built in Shanxi province, is a key example of Yuan Dynasty official architecture. It features four well-preserved wooden structures from that era. 

**Roofing and Materials:**
Double-eaved Xie-shan style roofs were common, and the use of glazed tiles, particularly peacock blue, became more prevalent. 

**Layout and Structure:**
Palace buildings often featured symmetrical layouts, with some employing eight-pillared structures for a sense of grandeur. 

**Adaptability:**
Sliding lattice windows and fully detachable square-grid doors and windows were used to adapt to different weather conditions and enhance functionality. 

**Decorative Elements:**
Intricate decorations and carvings adorned building foundations, and some structures incorporated honeycomb and rhomboid brick patterns. 

**Building Units:**
Complex buildings were often composed of repeated architectural units, with corridors used to connect different levels and sections. 

Beyond Palaces:
While palaces were a major focus, the Yuan Dynasty also saw the construction of tombs, theaters, and other structures, reflecting a broader range of architectural styles and functions. 

Dadu (Khanbaliq):
The capital city, Dadu (present-day Beijing), was planned according to the "Artificer's Record" (Kaogong ji) from the Zhou Dynasty, emphasizing a square layout and specific road and gate arrangements. 

Focus on Functionality and Aesthetics:
The Yuan Dynasty architecture aimed to balance practical considerations with aesthetic appeal, incorporating elements like adaptable windows and doors alongside decorative features.

Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long
Till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
