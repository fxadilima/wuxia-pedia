## *Dadu, August 1362: A Secret Departure*

Ayushiridara’s escape from Dadu was a desperate but calculated maneuver. He knew his family's survival hinged on secrecy. The riverbank he chose was no ordinary spot; it was the hidden exit of a long, secret tunnel, a lifeline built by his parents for emergencies. This passage, concealed behind library bookshelves in the palace, was known only to their immediate family and Empress Bayan. Every loyal worker who helped build it could be trusted with their lives.

Ayushiridara didn't wait long. As he ate a shaobing, a sturdy, simple carriage approached from the east, driven by Li Zhenxing. Ayushiridara nodded in satisfaction; Li Zhenxing had packed provisions for a long journey north, even winter clothes.

"Liang Zhihui and Furen are coming soon," Li Zhenxing said, accepting a shaobing. "Where does Taizi wish to go?"

"The bandits ruined my parents' plans," Ayushiridara replied, referring to the recent chaos. "We can't use Shangdu Palace now, it's too obvious. Do you have a suggestion? At worst, I'll temporarily stay in Ningxia."

Li Zhenxing began to grasp Ayushiridara's strategy. "This doesn't involve the Emperor?" he asked, a hint of caution in his voice.

"Eventually, it will, because my father still wants to rule," Ayushiridara explained. "So, we'll give him a new 'toy' to play with."

"Shangdu could still be used for that," Li Zhenxing mused, "but perhaps not now. We wait until their attention shifts elsewhere."

Ayushiridara's eyes sharpened. "Now is precisely the time! The Shandong incident must have drawn their attention. I believe they'll soon target the northeast, perhaps even Goryeo—through Liaoning."

"I understand," Li Zhenxing said, a wide grin spreading across his face. "We'll investigate. How will we contact Taizi?"

"I'll use the homing pigeon posts along the northern route to Ningxia," Ayushiridara confirmed. "I'll have them send my messages directly to the four of you. For now, don't tell my mother."

Soon after, his wife, Andong, emerged from the secret tunnel, which was camouflaged by wild plants. Ayushiridara embraced her. "Andong, we must leave quickly. Don't talk much; I'll explain on the way."

Andong's beautiful face furrowed in surprise. "Where are we going? Taking a two-month-old? Are you sure it's safe?"

Ayushiridara gently took their baby boy from her, kissing his cheek. "Have you named him?"

"*Muqin*[^muqin] named him—Elbeg," Andong replied.

Ayushiridara smiled faintly. His mother had chosen the name of a loyal follower of Zhang Wuji, a true Manichaean. He hadn't met Elbeg himself but was familiar with his companions. "That's a good name," he said. "Let's go."

He chose to drive the simple carriage himself. They would blend in as an ordinary young couple from Datong, disappearing into the vast northern plains, leaving behind the crumbling imperial capital and its deadly political games.

[^muqin]: Muqin (母親), a formal term to address a mother.

Actually, Zhao Min (surely) has no intention to meet Yin Yewang. She would only tell Zhou Zhiruo that she and Yin Li will be able to resolve the problen *if* they see Yin Yewang *together*, believing in the strength of 'forgiveness', through current relationship between Zhou Zhiruo and Yin Li, thus, also provides a chance for Yin Li and Yin Yewang to forgive each other. This move is brilliant, and very much Zhao Min.

"Yin Li's Current Sentiments": Actually is more complex. She already forgive Zhou Zhiruo, both explicitly and from the bottom of her heart. She escaped death. Tha's powerful enough to make her forget all of her past, that's why she also forget (or already realized better) her infatuation to her own cousin, Zhang Wuji (now she freely call him 'biaoge'). But her resentment toward her own father is far more difficult to resolved. Yin Li found happiness via Qi Shengniang's guidance, which in turn create a unique relationship with Chaghan Temur, who treat her like his own daughter. She wouls never accept Yin Yewang's stance against Chaghan Temur, even though Chaghan is now already in Heaven.

But then again, from Yin Yewang's side, Yin Li's act is unforgivable (and unfillial, too). First, she married *a Mongolian man* (Wang Baobao, who actually is half-Han), without his approval (and without even telling him)! Second: Yin Li becomes *a Mongolian's daughter*! Last but not least: Yin Li also becomes a goddaughter of a Mongolian Empress Bayan! All of this makes Zhao Min's plan not so easy to execute.

☝ After considering all of the above complex problems, I guess currently Zhao Min's plan just cannot be done. So, we should change the narrative, and leave this problems for now. Redirect the story to another complex (but more retable) issue.

The following historical text about Wang Baobao is more compeling:

"Wang Baobao received the name Köke Temür from Toghon Temür in 1361 when he delivered a shipment of grain to the capital. He succeeded his adoptive father when he died in 1362. Upon his father's death, Köke Temür was tasked with retaking Shandong from the rebels. He besieged the rebel base at Yidu and after several months, brought it down by tunneling under the walls. He captured the assassins of Chaghan Temur, Tian Feng and Wang Shicheng, and sacrificed them to his father's spirit. Meanwhile, due to Bolad Temur's machinations at court to remove crown prince Ayushiridara, Köke Temür remained estranged from court."

**New Direction: Focusing on Wang Baobao and Anfeng**

This pivot works beautifully. Instead of forcing an immediate and likely unsuccessful familial reconciliation, the narrative can now explore:

1. The Significance of Anfeng: Detail why Liu Futong and Han Lin'er, despite being "toothless tigers" to some, are crucial political pawns for various rebel factions, especially Zhang Shicheng.

2. Wang Baobao's Vengeance and Rise (as Köke Temür): This provides an immediate, compelling, and historically grounded plotline.

  - Wang Baobao (now Köke Temür) is actively tracking down the assassins of his adoptive father, Chaghan Temur (Tian Feng and Wang Shicheng). This is a strong personal motivation that drives his military actions.
  - His siege of Yidu and the tunneling strategy is a great tactical detail that can be vividly described.
  - His formal sacrifice of the assassins to Chaghan Temur's spirit underscores his loyalty and ferocity.

3. Internal Yuan Strife (Bolad Temur): The ongoing machinations of Bolad Temur against Köke Temür and Crown Prince Ayushiridara provide a continuous source of external political tension and potential strategic opportunities for Zhang Wuji.

4. Strategic Choices for Zhang Wuji's Ming Jiao:

  - How will Zhang Wuji react to Köke Temür's actions in Shandong? Is he an enemy, a potential ally against other rebels, or a temporary distraction for the Yuan?
  - What are the Ming Jiao's plans regarding Anfeng and the fate of Liu Futong and Han Lin'er? Will they intervene, and if so, on whose side?
  - How does the Ming Jiao plan to exploit the Yuan's internal weaknesses (Bolad Temur vs. Köke Temür) while simultaneously dealing with other rebel factions like Zhang Shicheng and Zhu Yuanzhang?

During the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), which was a Mongol-led dynasty, military commanders could be addressed in a few ways, reflecting both their Mongol origins and the adopted Chinese bureaucratic system.

Here are the most common ways to address a "commander":

 Noyan (那顏 / 那延): This is a direct Mongolian term for a noble or general. It was widely used for Mongol and even some non-Mongol military commanders. It signifies a high-ranking military leader, often commanding a tümen (10,000 troops) or mingghan (1,000 troops). This would be a very authentic and common term.

Darga (達魯花赤): This is a Mongolian term meaning "chief" or "commander," often used for administrators or commanders of smaller units like a zuut (100 troops) or aravt (10 troops), or even local officials. It's less a direct military rank for a large force commander and more of a general leadership title.

General (將軍, Jiāngjūn): This is the traditional Chinese term for a general. While the Yuan military had its own Mongol-based ranks, the Chinese system of titles was also in use, especially for Han Chinese officers or when interacting with Han Chinese populations.

Specific Unit Commanders:

萬戶 (Wànhù) / Wanhu: "Commander of Ten Thousand Households." This was a high-ranking position, essentially a commander of a tümen (division of 10,000 men).
千戶 (Qiānhù) / Qianhu: "Commander of a Thousand Households." This was a commander of a mingghan (regiment of 1,000 men).
 Ministerial/Bureaucratic Titles: High-ranking military officials might also hold titles within the Bureau of Military Affairs (樞密院, Shūmìyuàn).

知樞密院事 (Zhī Shūmìyuàn Shì): Administrator of the Bureau (head of the Bureau of Military Affairs).
樞密副使 (Shūmì Fùshǐ): Vice Military Affairs Commissioner (deputy head).
樞密大臣 (Shūmì Dàchén): Grand Minister of Military Affairs (commanded mobile bureaus during campaigns).
Wang (王): For extremely high-ranking military leaders, especially those with royal lineage or who were granted significant fiefs, they might hold the title of Prince (王, Wang), such as Chin Wang (親王) or Giyün Wang (郡王). This was a title of nobility that also often implied military command over their territory.

Given your context of Wang Baobao:

Wang Baobao, being a prominent Mongol general (and husband to Yin Li in your story), would most certainly be referred to as a Noyan by his Mongol subordinates and potentially by others familiar with Mongol military structure. He would also likely be referred to as 將軍 (Jiāngjūn) by Han Chinese or by those using more common Chinese military terminology. Given his significant stature, if he had been granted a princedood, "Wang" would also be appropriate.

For someone of his caliber, the most fitting direct address would likely be Noyan or 將軍 (Jiāngjūn).
