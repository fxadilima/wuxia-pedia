Because Chaghan Temur's assasination would be in June 1362, we still have a long time before entering the very devastating event in Zhang Wuji's group.

From Christmas Eve 1360 toward New Year's Eve 1361, we can move the story to Kaifeng.

But before I forgot, there's an important revision I have to make in the narrative for Zhang Wuji and Xiao Zhao's very simple and humble wedding, in Kaifeng, just before they leave with large number of people to the current Xumishan.

Chaghan Temur is Zhao Min's father, and also Kaifeng's most influencial figure at the time, how can we forgot to invite him? The wedding itself, in the current narrative is only featuring Mei Jian alone as the parent for both Zhang Wuji and Xiao Zhao (or Wang Baobao for Zhang Wuji's side). This setting looks odd, and not very compeling. I will make Chaghan Temur intentionally (considering he's actually eccentric), and unconventionally, act as Zhang Wuji's parent representation, and Mei Jian for Xiao Zhao.

‚òù "Now, with the wedding concluded and Chaghan Temur's blessing (and implicit warning to Li Siqi) given, are we ready to transition the narrative to Kaifeng between Christmas Eve 1360 and New Year's Eve 1361?"
- Sure thing!

Let's take a good look at Zhu Yuanzhang's activity in historical context:

In 1361, he began minting copper coins, and by 1363, 38 million coins were being produced in one year. In 1362, custom offices were set up to collect taxes on traditional and commercial goods.

We now set the stage for Ah Xiu's brilliant mind against the above plans.

Second facts (after Chaghan Temur's death in 1362, now is still 1361):

In 1363, Zhang Shicheng attacked the Song court in Anfeng. Zhu personally led his army to defend them against Zhang and while Liu Futong was killed, Zhu managed to save Han Lin'er, whom he moved to Chuzhou where the Song court continued to exist in safety. In the same year, Zhu won the Battle of Lake Poyang against his rival Chen Youliang, and proceeded to eliminate Zhang Shicheng and Fang Guozhen. He spent most of 1364 and 1365 consolidating the territory he absorbed from his victory over Zhang.

About Ah Xiu:

1. In Desember 1360, we stated that her pregnancy was already 4 months, we start fresh in Jan 1361.
2. We must foreshadow that Zhu Yuanzhang began minting copper coins, and that means he will set up some teams to collect taxes on traditional and commercial goods.
3. Ah Xiu herself, physcally, definitely, becomes more and more limited, considering her pregnancy.
4. Dongfang Yuxian and Murong Bing back from Ningxia.

Aaah, that's wrong! Dongfang Yuxian and Murong Bing were coming from north west, how can they know anything about Zhu Yuanzhang's activity during their trip to Xiangyang, while Zhu Yuanzhang's territory is in modern day's Nanjing?

Murong Bing added, "Zhang Wuji sends his greetings. The northwest seems a promising start for our people."
- Murong Bing *is* obviously Zhang Wuji's subordinate, impossible for her to call him by the name just like that!

"Zhang Wuji Jiaozhu": again, to maintain consistency, Murong Bing always use short, but precise "Jiaozhu", like mosr the others

Ah Xiu offered them a warm smile. "Welcome back. Your firsthand accounts of the north are vital. Rest now, but later, tell me everything you observed in the regions surrounding our own and any news you might have heard from travelers heading south or east."
- Ah Xiu and the people of Xiangyang would be the best choice, Murong Bing and Dongfang Yuxian are gathering another informations, most likely Zhang Wuji's opinions and something else. 

---

"Sima Han and Wei Yixiao"
- Ah Xiu would likely use Zhang Wuji's addressing, "Sima Zhanglao" and "Wei Fuwang", not a direct names

"Sima Zhanglao and Wei Fuwang have been keeping me informed of whispers from the south and east, but your insights from the north, and any news you gathered along the way, will also be valuable in understanding the larger picture."
- Sima Han is the key administrator in Xiangyang, and will never leave to gather any informations outside. Ah Xiu would likely send Zhang Wuji's 'Little Secret Force' for this purpose

"Shangguan siblings, Ah Zhu"
- Shangguan Siblings and Ah Zhu is still in Ningxia, and will not be available for a very long time in other places. This 'Little Secret Force' is currently booming to more than 2000 individuals! Ah Xiu can order Yu Daiyan and Bei Jinyi to select any appropriate small team based on this.

Elder Yu, Bei Jinyi:
- Cannot use these addressing, as Yu Daiyan is Zhang Wuji's 3rd martial uncle, and Bei Jinyi is Zhou Zhiruo's elder martial sister. Ah Xiu would likely adopted "Yu Sanbo" and "Bei Shijie".

Ah Xiu, at this state, would likely sow discord between Zhu Yuanzhang and Chen Youliang, but will carefully make the battle occured in Lake Poyang, which is safer for common people
