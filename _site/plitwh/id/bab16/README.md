Historically, Liu Bowen said these lines:

"Youliang's territory included Rao Prefecture and Xin Prefecture; and spanned from the Jing to the Xiang, nearing half of the world. Shicheng is occupied with defending himself against the barbarians, hence he is not a worry to us. Youliang betrayed his lord and threatens his subordinates; he has no legitimacy. He occupies the upriver territory, and we are always on his mind; hence, we should take him first. After the Chen family is eliminated, the Zhang family is isolated, and can be eliminated with one fell swoop."

"Before launching a final attack on the enemy's heartland, the Suzhou region, Zhu and his generals decided to first "cut off the wings" of Wu by occupying the territory north of the Yangtze and the Wu part of Zhejiang. Xu Da was appointed as the supreme commander of the attacking troops, and the plan was executed with ease due to the attacking army's superiority. The ten-month siege of Suzhou began in December 1366."
