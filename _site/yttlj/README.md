# Slaying the Dragon, Executing the Mandate of Heaven

This repository contains "Book 1" of a reimagined Yitian Tulong Ji (倚天屠龍記), Jin Yong's epic. This rewrite prioritizes historical accuracy while striving to maintain the spirit of the original narrative.

As detailed in the [my front page](../README.md), my research began with "Chapter 34" of the fan-translated English version, specifically at the point where young Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min meet Chaghan Temur, Zhao Min's biological father. However, I've also incorporated entirely new elements not explored in Jin Yong's original work. This led to the decision to rewrite the entire story, as it became challenging to weave the new core elements into the existing narrative seamlessly.


## A Reimagined Beginning

The original Jin Yong novel features a lengthy prologue, largely detailing young Zhang Sanfeng's encounter with Yang Guo, thereby connecting this story to the second trilogy in Jin Yong's original narrative. However, much of that heavy narrative isn't significantly revisited in later developments. I've utilized this prologue section to introduce a different background, one largely unexplored in Jin Yong's original work: the story of a little girl born in Haengju in 1315, who would eventually become Empress Qi — a pivotal figure whose personal history is essential to fully understand the late Yuan Dynasty era depicted in this story.

This rewrite prioritizes historical accuracy where possible, while carefully preserving pivotal narrative events that are foundational to the original story.

For instance, Zhang Sanfeng's 100th birthday in 1341, and the tragic events surrounding it, remain a core anchor for the narrative. However, this commitment to Jin Yong's essential plot points means that certain historical details from earlier eras have been adjusted to serve the story's internal consistency.

This prologue will feature Zhang Sanfeng himself, reflecting on his youth and a pivotal encounter with Guo Xiang in his twenties. This allows for a more personal and historically flexible account of their meeting, subtly hinting at his lingering admiration for her. Critically, it also establishes Guo Jing, Huang Rong, and Guo Xiang as the original creators of the Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao, solidifying their legendary status within the narrative.

Alongside this, we introduce Empress Qi (born Qi Shengniang in 1315 in Haengju, Goryeo) and her martial arts master, Duoluo Haoyu. Born in 1230, Duoluo Haoyu is a veteran of Zhongyuan, having fled to Goryeo after the fall of Xiangyang and the death of Guo Jing. He serves as a vital, albeit fictional, historical source for the era, having learned from Yelu Qi after Guo Jing and Huang Rong's demise. His subsequent mastery of martial arts, including the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms and Yue Nü Jian Fa from Han Xiaoying, explains Qi Shengniang's profound knowledge of these techniques, providing a direct link between the legendary past and the future Empress. Her deep connection to this master, who passed away when she was around eleven, also adds a personal tragedy shaping her character.
