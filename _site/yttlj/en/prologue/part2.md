# Prologue
## *Haengju, December 1324: A Little Fairy Soars*

The content of the "mere" eighteen stances proved far more difficult to grasp than Douluo Jing had initially imagined. He frowned, tracing his father's writing on one of the book's pages. "Forget Ki Son-yeo," he thought, "even I don't easily understand the meaning of all this." How would this child ever learn it later?

But his attention was immediately drawn to the term "Feilong Zai Tian" (飛龍在天), the name of the second stance among the eighteen. This was an ancient proverb, depicting a flying dragon in the sky, capable of finding exceptional individuals below. From its unique vantage point, the dragon would have a clear view of worldly affairs, thus being able to track the footsteps of those with good intentions and wisdom.

Connecting all of this to Ki Son-yeo, he chuckled to himself. His father was quite something, he thought, this isn't a Flying Dragon in the Sky, but a Little Fairy Soaring (小精靈在天).

Douluo Jing was just thinking that when Ki Son-yeo furrowed her brow and asked, "Uncle, what does 'Kanglong You Hui' (亢龍有悔) mean? Why would a dragon have regrets?"

Scratching his head, Douluo Jing replied, "Well, even Uncle doesn't know. You'd best just memorize all of it. The easiest way is to rewrite everything you can remember from what Uncle read today, because that's what Father also said."

From childhood, Ki Son-yeo was accustomed to memorizing everything read to her before her master would explain it all. Memorizing this not-too-thick book wasn't too difficult for her, though it would take time. But her curiosity deeply bothered her. "Uncle, is all of this martial arts?" she asked, thinking to herself that she wouldn't pay too much attention if it wasn't.

"Of course," Douluo Jing replied. "Uncle is also trying to understand it."

Ki Son-yeo diligently memorized what her uncle-master read to her every day, always taking diligent notes of what she could recall to aid her memorization. Her master did provide explanations for the meaning of each name. Yet, even those explanations weren't easy to grasp. She wondered to herself, what did any of this have to do with fighting?

Meanwhile, Douluo Jing gradually began to grasp the meaning of his father's writings, discovering how they could be applied in martial arts. He often heard his father's stories, relayed from Yelu Qi, about how Guo Jing initially practiced all of this.

Guo Jing wasn't a clever man; what he did was diligently repeat what Hong Qigong taught him, until he finally understood and immersed himself in its meaning, all while his fists and palms bled from punching trees all day. Douluo Haoyu thought, "If we think from the perspective of a smarter person, we'll most likely fail, because this teaching wasn't compiled by Hong Qigong for clever people with complicated minds who tend to make their own assumptions." His father's instruction, 'Kanglong You Hui,' was like a furious person, channeling all their strength to strike an opponent, but then retracting some of that strength out of regret. This method of retracting one's own strength was the key. When hitting a tree, you had to imagine that the tree shouldn't even budge; one punch should fell it instantly.

While teaching and reading his father's writings every day, Douluo Jing himself also tried to practice what he understood, but so far, he had completely failed. The result was, he ended up just like his father's story about Guo Jing. His hands bled from punching trees.

## *Haengju, Early 1325: A Quiet Departure*

Every day, as she diligently memorized each page of her master's writings, Ki Son-yeo sometimes saw her uncle rubbing his fists, vaguely noticing bruises, even wounds wrapped in cloth. She wondered to herself, was her uncle perhaps secretly trying their master's advice to punch trees every day?

Unfortunately, while Ki Son-yeo sometimes directly asked her master questions that arose in their minds during memorization, when the old man happened to be able to talk, suddenly, one afternoon, she found her uncle weeping loudly beside her master's couch. "Father, Father... Hai'er (your son) is unfilial... Hai'er didn't get to speak with you one last time, Father..."

A chilling thought flashed through Ki Son-yeo's mind. She rushed to her master's bamboo couch and shook the old man, who lay rigid in his sleep. His eyes were closed, a faint smile gracing his lips. "Shifu... Shifu, don't leave dizi (your disciple)! Shifu...!" But her master didn't wake again.

She cried and screamed with all her might to call her master, but the old man's hands were already cold and stiff, and no breath stirred from his nostrils.

For the first time, Ki Son-yeo felt as though half her soul had been pulled out, carried away by her master. People often spoke of death; she had never witnessed it herself, but now she was experiencing firsthand that someone said to be 'dead' would truly never rise again. At this moment, she could still see her master, who looked incredibly old, yet, he seemed so content, as if he had just found something deeply satisfying. She wanted to gaze at him longer, to imprint the image of this old man in her heart. After this, when people buried her master in a hole and covered it with earth, she would never be able to meet him again.

Both their hearts felt cold, as cold as the hands and feet of their master—her uncle's biological father—who was now weeping beside her.

The biting wind from the window, at the end of winter, added to the chill in the room. Douluo Jing and Ki Son-yeo remained lost in thought, reluctant to leave their beloved father and master.

Further Heartbreak
Aunt Lian arrived with her family a few days later. She had just given birth to her third child, a beautiful baby girl. She too could only weep, having missed the chance to see Douluo Haoyu one last time before his passing. "Father, your granddaughter was just born... why did you hurry away? This child doesn't even have a name yet; we were waiting for you to give her one..."

Douluo Haoyu's wife, a Goryeo woman, had passed away about ten years prior, before Ki Son-yeo was born. At that time, Douluo Jing was barely twenty; now he was thirty and still unmarried. Douluo Lian was married to a man from Shandong named Yang Dao. They had two older sons named Yang Rui and Yang Jun.

Yang Dao said, "Yuefu was so concerned about Son-yeo lately. Let's just name our child 'Shaonu'."

"Hey, that's good," Douluo Jing said with a smile. "Son-yeo now has a little sister. She'll be happy."

But just as he finished speaking, a servant from Ki Ja-oh's house arrived with news, speaking in broken Han language. "Shaoye (Young Master), Son-yeo's mother just passed away—the child is unconscious now..."

"What?" The three people present were utterly shocked. Yang Rui and Yang Jun were also stunned. Both boys were over ten years old and understood what had just happened.

---

Ki Ja-oh, now nearing sixty, was a military commander in Inju. Though he didn't hold a high rank, he was still of noble descent. The atmosphere of grief at Ki Son-yeo's residence starkly contrasted with the quiet, cold bamboo hut where Ki Son-yeo had last been alone with Douluo Jing, accompanying Douluo Haoyu's remains.

When they arrived, many people were crowded around the unconscious Ki Son-yeo. Without hesitation or regard for formalities, Douluo Lian said, "You're all crowding too closely! This child can't breathe! Leave her be; we'll stay with her!" Without a moment's doubt, she carried the little girl into her room, accompanied only by the servant who had brought them the news.

Seeing Ki Ja-oh slumped, spiritless and weary, Douluo Jing and Yang Dao approached him with warm tea. "*Hyeongnim*[^hyeongnim]," Douluo Jing said, offering the teacup, "Calm yourself. How could this have happened so suddenly?"

[^hyeongnim]: Hyeongnim (형님) or "Gege", "Elder Brother".

Ki Ja-oh sighed deeply. "Truthfully, she's had problems for a long time. According to the physician, her heart wasn't strong. This morning we received this news..." He handed them a short letter.

On the parchment, only a brief sentence was written: 'His Majesty has arrived today,' with no sender's name. "Who sent this?" Yang Dao asked, his brow slightly furrowed.

"My wife had someone waiting for news of His Majesty's return," Ki Ja-oh explained. "She just wanted to tell Son-yeo something. Regardless, we couldn't cancel that engagement. I suppose this news shocked her..."

"Oh!" Yang Dao and Douluo Jing immediately understood. It seemed that all this time, Ki Son-yeo's mother had been preparing the little girl to receive news of a formal proposal that, in her imagination, might arrive as soon as King Chungsuk returned. This letter confirmed that their King had indeed arrived in Goryeo. It appeared the news of his arrival had intentionally not been widely disseminated.

About ten minutes later, Ki Son-yeo emerged from her room with Douluo Lian and a servant. The little girl looked rather pale, having experienced two huge losses in quick succession. "Eomma..." she murmured. She then went into the room where her mother's body lay and wept there. Douluo Lian and the servant accompanied her.

Feeling at a loss for words to comfort Ki Son-yeo, Douluo Jing and Yang Dao simply kept Ki Ja-oh company, lending him a sympathetic ear.

The customary ceremonies before Yi Haeng-gom's burial proceeded orderly, despite a fairly large number of attendees.

---

After these events, Ki Son-yeo, though visibly grieving, trained her kungfu even more diligently; it was clear she was trying to keep herself occupied. She also obeyed her father and older brothers' commands to receive Wang Jeong courteously when he visited. They faithfully observed the three-year mourning period according to Goryeo custom. No formal proposals were sent. There was no talk of marriage, even though Wang Jeong occasionally visited the house with his guards.

Together with Douluo Lian and her husband, Yang Dao, they finally discussed the martial arts legacy left by Douluo Haoyu, which they found so difficult to understand. For Douluo Haoyu's two children, the reason finally became clear. Their father had witnessed Yelu Qi demonstrate this martial art firsthand, just as Guo Jing had directly observed Hong Qigong's demonstrations, while they had not. Douluo Haoyu had never passed down this art to anyone before. This was why they struggled to grasp the meaning of the writing. Hong Qigong himself had never written any martial arts manual, nor had his predecessors. Most of the Beggar's Sect's martial arts were passed down directly through oral instruction and demonstration.

"It's a pity," Ki Son-yeo said, disappointed. "Shifu must be very disappointed. No one can learn it."

But Yang Dao said, "You don't need to think that way. Look closely, all these names are taken from the Yijing! At the very least, we can learn from that. 'Feilong Zai Tian,' 'Jianlong Zhai Tian,' and so on. If we contemplate it with the *Yijing*[^yijing] as our guide, someday we're sure to understand." He was born in the region where Jiang Ziya originated, a figure who played a significant role in the formation of the Zhou Dynasty. He was completely familiar with these terms.

[^yijing]: Yijing (易經), "Kitab Perubahan". Kumpulan tulisan dari Dinasti Zhou.

Douluo Jing was certainly familiar with the term 'Feilong Zai Tian,' having been taught it since childhood. But he saw it from a martial arts perspective. "Jiefu," he said, "what's certain is that, according to Father, this stance—Feilong Zai Tian—is performed with a high leap. But to execute it, besides requiring good qinggong, it also demands strong internal energy. Even I can't do it right now. How could Father expect Shengniang to learn it?"

Yang Dao chuckled. "I think Father didn't mean for her to learn it now, which is why Shengniang was only told to memorize it. Later, when she's more mature and has a much better foundation, then all of it will truly become meaningful."

Ki Son-yeo didn't have a direct family relationship with Yang Dao. She had always called Douluo Lian 'Shigu,' meaning 'Aunt-master.' Now she was a little confused about how she should address Yang Dao. She hesitated to call him 'Guzhang,' opting instead for the more common term for an elder brother from her paternal side. She had recently often heard her master talk about Yuan Dynasty politics and assumed that dragons were symbols of the emperor. "Yang Bobo, perhaps Shifu wanted to say something else. Isn't 'Dragon' a symbol of the emperor?"

Yang Dao looked at her with pleasure, for two reasons. He was pleased because the address 'Bobo' sounded familiar and affectionate to him, and he was also happy to see the child's intelligence. His eyes sparkled as he replied, "Indeed, that could very well be. Think about it: at least the first three stances could symbolize a series of events involving Jiang Ziya and King Ji Fa's father!"

Three pairs of eyes immediately looked at him with curiosity. All of them had, to varying degrees, received basic Yijing lessons from Douluo Haoyu himself, who had learned much from Huang Rong in his youth. But Yang Dao, raised in Shandong, had studied it from the region that was Jiang Ziya's domain. Naturally, he possessed an understanding with a very different nuance.

Ki Son-yeo, still a child, was only told to memorize the lines of terms. Her master hadn't had the chance to explain these things more deeply, but she had already heard Douluo Haoyu's stories connecting the folklore of the Zhou Dynasty with the "dragons" often mentioned in the classic text. For her, the first words she remembered most vividly were Douluo Haoyu's own opinion: that the creature called a 'Dragon' didn't actually exist. It was merely a symbol of immense power, transcending human capabilities, perhaps even mystical, connected to 'Heaven.'

She once heard her master's story about Jiang Ziya fishing in a river with a hook but no bait, then meeting King Ji Fa's father, who would later overthrow the Shang Dynasty and establish the Zhou Dynasty. In Douluo Haoyu's telling, the two men miraculously recognized each other, believing the encounter to be the 'Will of Heaven.' But she saw no connection between the text and this event, and asked, "Yang Bobo, what's the connection between dragons and Jiang Ziya and King Ji Fa's father?"

"Aha! Let's look at the first stance — 'Kanglong You Hui'[^kanglong-you-hui]," Yang Dao said, his eyes sparkling. He was delighted by Ki Son-yeo's curiosity. "This is actually line *nine from the top*[^shang-jiu-yue] of the Yijing." He then adopted the posture of a teacher explaining something to a young disciple, mimicking his father-in-law's manner when teaching Ki Son-yeo, which felt comforting to the child. "If a person tries to do something too grand, exceeding their own capabilities, they will begin to lose connection with those around them and feel isolated. This will, of course, lead to failure. Therefore, if we have very grand ambitions, it's best to be careful!"

[^shang-jiu-yue]: Shang Jiu Yue (上九曰), "Nine at the top".

Douluo Lian and Douluo Jing smiled, each for their own reasons. Douluo Lian felt her husband's teaching was a very common way to instruct young children, while Douluo Jing found a connection between Yang Dao's explanation and the theory of 'restraining and retracting one's own energy' that he had understood so far.

Ki Son-yeo, who hadn't yet seen the connection between Yang Dao's explanation and the story of Jiang Ziya and King Ji Fa's father, asked, "Yang Bobo, what does that have to do with Jiang Ziya?"

This time, it was Douluo Lian who connected it. "Before, Jiang Ziya was an official of the Shang Dynasty. Feeling dissatisfied with the cruelty there, he then pretended to be mad and disappeared, which is why he was found fishing in the river, very old, in another place."

[^kanglong-you-hui]: Kanglong You Hui (亢龍有悔), "The Proud Dragon Remorsed".

"Oh!" said Ki Son-yeo. She immediately saw the connection from the story of Jiang Ziya and Ji Chang, who was the father of Ji Fa. Ji Fa himself would later become King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty. In her master's story, Ji Chang was a skilled diviner who felt he'd encounter a "great beast of prey" before going hunting. When he saw Jiang Ziya fishing without bait, he asked, "How will you catch fish if you fish without bait?" Jiang Ziya replied, "Once the fish are ready to be caught, they will come on their own." Though it sounded like a jest, her master's story left a deep impression on Ki Son-yeo because it was then that Ji Chang was said to have "immediately recognized that Jiang Ziya was the beast of prey mentioned in his divination," while from Jiang Ziya's perspective, Ji Chang was seen as an official who successfully recognized him while in a high position. From that moment, according to her master, Jiang Ziya became the teacher of both Ji Chang and Ji Fa. This made the meaning of 'Feilong Zai Tian' suddenly make sense to Ki Son-yeo. The dragon in that context, she now connected to Ji Chang, an official.

"Say the second one is true," Douluo Jing said, his expression still puzzled. "But 'Seeing the Dragon in the Field' seems to symbolize nothing to me."

"Aha!" Yang Dao exclaimed. "Jianlong Zai Tian, Li Jian Daren (見龍在田 , 利見大人) — it is fortunate to meet an official. Imagine, if a 'Dragon' were seen in the field, what would happen? The dragon was previously in the high heavens. People in that era would be terrified if they saw Di Xin, the then King of Shang, appear among them. This was a disaster, because Di Xin was considered cruel. But why would they feel fortunate?"

"Of course, because they feel the king is their friend!" Ki Son-yeo replied. "Ji Chang was a friend to the people!"

Yang Dao grew even fonder of the little girl. In his eyes, Ki Son-yeo's way of connecting the two logics was truly special. "That means Ji Chang had *great influence* among the people. Now do you understand why Jiang Ziya immediately agreed to be his teacher?"

The lesson seemed to hang, suspended in the cold, late-winter air of the grieving home. Ki Son-yeo's small face was still solemn from her recent losses, but a new light shone in her eyes, a spark ignited by Yang Dao's words. The "dragon" was not just a symbol of mystic power, but also of leadership and a ruler's connection to their people. It was a king who could be "a friend to the people," like Ji Chang. This resonated with her in a way that the raw martial application of the technique hadn't yet. It echoed in her ears, in a manner that her master's rough martial theories couldn't. She held all of Yang Dao's teachings close to her heart, hoping that one day she would see the 'dragon' herself in an open field.

However, Douluo Jing still rubbed his bruised knuckles, Yang Dao's philosophy failing to illuminate his physical frustration. He certainly saw the profundity of the Yijing, but the leap from ancient wisdom to bleeding hands remained stubbornly unmade. He looked at his brother-in-law, Yang Dao, with a mixture of respect and exasperation. Yang Dao's calm demeanor, his easy grasp of these ancient texts, was both impressive and, for Douluo Jing, a little irritating; how easily his brother-in-law explained everything, while he himself could never find the right words to explain the same things to Ki Son-yeo.

"Yang Bobo," Ki Son-yeo spoke again, her voice quiet but firm, "If the Dragon in the Field means a good leader, what happens if the 'dragon' is not good? What if the king is cruel, like Di Xin?"

Yang Dao smiled faintly. "Ah, Shengniang, that is where the stories of the Zhou Dynasty truly begin. A cruel 'dragon' will inevitably bring about change, but the path to that change is fraught with difficulty and sacrifice. It requires a different kind of 'dragon' to rise." He paused, his gaze thoughtful. "Yang Bobo's ancestors understood these things very well. They lived through times of great upheaval, when heaven itself seemed to weep." He chuckled lightly as he said the last sentence.

He glanced at Douluo Jing, a silent understanding passing between them. It was knowledge rooted in history, in the echoes of legendary figures, and in the very bloodline that now flowed through Yang Dao's veins. He wanted to speak more, to share a secret he had kept close for decades, a story of the Dragon and the Snake that had shaped his own family's destiny. But then he became hesitant. His ancestors had advised them to live simply, even believing that 'names' were unimportant, symbolizing nothing more than a tool to call someone. Should he tell the story of his ancestors? To this day, people still remembered the Guo Jing family, but they never knew where his ancestors were when Xiangyang fell to Kublai Khan and Guo Jing himself died. He also didn't know how to tell it all. Perhaps people would view his ancestors poorly.

---

That afternoon, before the sun dipped below the western horizon, Douluo Jing said, "It's getting late. We must practice your swordplay. Don't waste any more time!" He leaped ahead of Ki Son-yeo onto a large rock in the middle of the river, a sight that reminded everyone of how Douluo Haoyu used to teach them everything.

At the entrance to the bamboo hut, Douluo Lian smiled faintly, asking her husband, "You didn't tell her anything about your ancestors?"

Taking a deep breath, Yang Dao chuckled and said, looking towards the small Ki Son-yeo, who was practicing Yue Nu Jian Fa (越女劍法—Maiden of Yue Sword Art) with her uncle-master on the large rock. "You see this extraordinary child. She'd surely ask if she truly wanted to know about my ancestors, but she hasn't. They weren't the right people to be 'Dragons' or anything at that time. My ancestor didn't even know he had killed Möngke Khan. Others were the ones who said it. To my ancestors, those folk tales tended to be exaggerated. Their kung fu was indeed high, but if you listen to those folk tales, you get the impression my ancestors could fly!" He burst into laughter, then his expression grew somewhat serious as he continued, "Lian'er, do you think my ancestors were wrong or right?"

Smiling faintly, Douluo Lian didn't immediately answer. Her gaze was also fixed on the large rock in the middle of the river, then observing the flowing water around it. As Yang Dao's wife, she had, of course, heard her family's stories about Yang Guo, who had disappeared with Xiaolongnü. Even Guo Xiang couldn't find a trace of them until the very end. It was said that before Xiangyang fell to Kublai Khan and Guo Jing himself died along with his family, except for Guo Xiang, Yang Guo had only sent his extremely heavy sword made of strange metal. This very sword of Yang Guo was the material used to forge a pair of sword and saber, which had now also vanished in the martial world, their whereabouts unknown. At that time, neither Yang Guo nor Xiaolongnü themselves appeared, greatly disappointing Guo Xiang. Some people then began to wonder: the Guo Jing family died, but Yang Guo didn't; where were they? Did they truly fight against Kublai Khan, or could they have perhaps joined him?

At that time, Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü already had two sons, aged ten and eight. Both children were born to Xiaolongnü when she was over forty years old. The family did not follow Kublai Khan, nor did they join the fight against him. They retreated to a place, the exact location of which Yang Dao himself did not know.

Yang Guo's two sons had numerous descendants, not all of whom were known to Yang Dao. Yang Dao was just one of the grandchildren of Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, born in Shandong. They knew of several other families, living far apart from each other. Some were in Sichuan, Zhongxing, Huashan, and some even lived around Kunlun Mountain. They didn't know all of them. Yang Guo himself was part of a society that, to Yang Dao and Douluo Lian, felt very ancient. It made more sense because Douluo Lian's own father married at an old age, after fleeing to Goryeo. Now, after her own father had just died, Douluo Lian began to feel how ancient the story of Yang Guo was, as if it had no connection to them at all.

She then said, "Right or wrong, I don't know. All I know is, if everyone had died then, or become a nun like Guo Xiang, then I wouldn't have met you. Our children wouldn't have been born either. Even if it was 'wrong,' I prefer your ancestors were 'wrong'!"

Yang Dao chuckled, calling out to his sons, Yang Rui and Yang Jun, who were playing in the bamboo grove. "You're disappointed, but I don't even understand martial arts myself. If you want, you can teach it to Rui'er and Jun'er!"

Douluo Lian kissed the cheek of the baby girl in her arms. The infant burped, then laughed joyfully, touching her mother's cheek. She was only three months old, her skin very fair and smooth. She was comfortably swaddled in thick yellow cloth. Douluo Lian asked the child, who, of course, didn't understand what she was saying, "Shaonu, do you want to learn kungfu too?"

Meanwhile, in Dadu, bronze cannons mounted on four-wheeled carriages began to be utilized by the Yuan Dynasty. They called them *qian qiu lei pao*[^qian-qiu-lei-pao].

[^qian-qiu-lei-pao]: Qian Qiu Lei Pao (千球雷砲), 'thousand-ball thunder cannons'.

In the Altai Mountains, Kusala drank airag with round bread and roasted lamb. Across from him, Babusha, his wife, accompanied their son as he played. Babusha was not Toghon's birth mother but treated him like her own child. She was also currently pregnant. The boy, now five years old, seemed bright and cheerful, greatly enjoying the stories his mother told about the kung fu heroes of Zhongyuan.

Toghon Temür asked, for the umpteenth time, "So these people can fly?"

His father burst into laughter. "Do you think anyone can fly?"

"Mother said Xiaolongnü could fly," Toghon blurted out.

"Your mother said, 'Xiaolongnü glided towards the Taoist priests surrounding her,' not flew," Kusala corrected, observing the boy intently. "People often exaggerate when they tell stories. If a leopard enters this tent and we run out, by the time that story travels from tent to tent, the leopard will be bigger and our family will seem more numerous."

Toghon grew even more curious. "So how did she 'glide'?"

"With a long sash," his mother replied, winking at Kusala. "The sash was tied to a tree!"

"Ah!" Toghon exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. An idea began to form in his mind.

But his mother quickly added, "Now, you mustn't try it yourself—you'll definitely fall!"

"Why?"

"Because you're still small," Babusha said again, taking a piece of bread, filling its center with small slices of meat, and offering it to Toghon. "Now, eat a lot so you'll grow quickly."

His father burst into laughter. "Yes, and then we'll enter Khanbaliq (Dadu, modern Beijing). You can sit there."

Babusha clucked her tongue in annoyance. "You're ruining the mood."

"Why? Is it not allowed?" Kusala said, still laughing. "Wasn't my brother appointed Prince of Huai? Why shouldn't my son sit on the throne, which should rightfully belong to our family? It's because Mailaiti's father got involved that we're exiled now."

Mailaiti's father was Temüder, who had indeed supported Dagi's idea to remove Kusala and his younger brother, Tugh Temür, from the capital, simply because they were not born to a Khongirad Khatun.

"But now Mailaiti's father is dead, and your formidable grandmother is also gone, even Mailaiti herself is dead," Babusha said, a hint of exasperation in her voice. "Why are we talking about this again? Aren't we still respected here? For me, that's enough."

"That's enough for you, not for me," Kusala countered. "For me, they all have to pay dearly after this."

"As far as I know, you were also granted the title of 'Prince', weren't you?" Babusha pressed. "But you yourself chose to leave Yunnan."

"Ah, yes," Kusala laughed. "My formidable grandmother gave me a title, just so I wouldn't cause trouble during the enthronement of Sidibala."

"I only know you did cause trouble in Shaanxi," Babusha retorted. "Indeed, we weren't married then; I don't know the full story, and you don't need to tell me again. But once more, all of that is in the past. Aren't our family doing well now? Why do you keep stirring up these matters? They're a source of disaster!" She groaned, holding her stomach. "Aih, you're making this child cry!"

Kusala hurried to help her sit. Toghon also held his stepmother's hand. "Niang, are you alright?"

Babusha affectionately stroked the boy's head. "If you eat a lot, Niang will certainly be alright."

Kusala didn't want to prolong the debate with Babusha, who he felt didn't truly grasp the full scope of their situation. At that time, he had indeed intended to rebel against his grandmother, Dagi, who wanted to enthrone Sidibala as both Khan and Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty. His father—who was also Tugh Temür's father—had married a woman of Ikhires descent, their shared mother. This led his grandmother to believe that neither of them could ascend to the throne. In fact, to support the maternal lineage, which his grandmother considered obligatory to be held by the Khongirad clan, she even disliked their father, Khayishan.

To ensure they wouldn't disrupt his grandmother's grand plans, both he and Tugh Temür were exiled far from Khanbaliq. He himself was sent to Yunnan but was given the title of 'King,' merely as a consolation. However, a Khan from the Chagatai clan, Esen Bukha, heard that he was living in his domain at the time and came to greet him.

Kusala knew, of course, that Esen Bukha undoubtedly had his own political interests, but he certainly needed help. Why refuse it? He even went on to marry Mailaiti, Toghon's birth mother, who was clearly the daughter of his enemy, Temüder. At that time, Temüder had actively supported his grandmother's idea to remove both him and Tugh Temür!

While his younger brother, Tugh Temür, had now accepted the title of Prince of Huai from Yesün Temür and resided first in Jiankang then Jiangling, Kusala deliberately chose to remain in the north, far from the capital, gathering more supporters. He was convinced that, in due time, he would have the opportunity to reclaim his family's rights, which had been lost due to his grandmother's ambition.

Babusha was right; they still enjoyed the support of their father's loyal adherents and those from the Borjigin lineage.

He didn't even feel the need to move himself at this moment. His father's loyal supporter, El Temür, was currently building strength in Dadu.
