# Prologue

## *Baodinglu: September, 1327: The Little Fairy Comes of Age*

Tajkis arrived back in Baodinglu, where they had separated, almost simultaneously with Fan Yao, who was riding with Qi Shengniang who had already regained consciousness. The little girl still looked somewhat pale, not fully recovered, although Fan Yao found no internal injuries after examining her thoroughly. Along the way, she seemed to be holding back pain and clutching her stomach, but she only shook her head each time Fan Yao asked how she felt, answering curtly, "I'm fine."

For some reason he couldn't explain himself, Fan Yao found that answer unsatisfactory. But, as a man, he naturally couldn't examine Qi Shengniang's condition more thoroughly, as that would involve touching parts of her body that would raise questions for many.

Seeing the two from a distance, Tajkis, Mei Jian, and Ah Luo immediately greeted them boisterously, "Hey! Why did you take so long? What happened?" Ah Luo asked.

Tajkis helped Qi Shengniang dismount and led her to a tavern they were using as a meeting point. In front of the tavern, Yin Susu was waiting. "Baatar came, telling us to head west immediately, he said Xie Daxia is heading to Guangming Ding!"

"Forget that, I already know," Tajkis said.

"What happened?" Yin Susu asked again, followed by some of her companions with the same question.

Briefly, Tajkis recounted what they had heard from Xie Xun himself, and that Yang Xiao had already taken him back to Guangming Ding.

"Hm! So it really was Xie Xun who did everything," Fan Yao said, clearly very anxious. "Then what next? This makes us the guilty party! If the Ming Cult is already called the 'Demonic Cult', now it really seems like that name is true!"

But Ah Luo was focusing on another matter. She had noticed Qi Shengniang's unusual demeanor for a while. This time, too, she was just quiet, like someone holding back pain. "Qi Shimei, are you alright?"

Hearing the news about Xie Xun, Fan Yao now finally remembered Qi Shengniang's condition. He quickly said, "She took a blow from Cheng Kun, I'm worried something's wrong. You all know, I'm a man, so..."

Tajkis was very surprised. She knew Cheng Kun's epithet was 'Lightning Hand', and there must be a reason for it. Anxiously, she checked Qi Shengniang's pulse, saying, "You... where did you get hit?" She anxiously examined the little girl's entire body, but then Yin Susu's eyes widened after seeing Qi Shengniang's back, she cleared her throat, then lowered her voice, "Qi Shimei, you... is this your first time?"

Her attitude made Fan Yao suspicious. "What is it? Is she internally injured?"

Hurriedly, Yin Susu said, "Oh, no... we'll check later, don't worry." She smiled, somewhat mysteriously, which made Fan Yao even more suspicious.

But Qi Shengniang quickly said, "I'm fine, Er Shige, don't worry," her face flushing. Internally, she felt something strange. She really liked Fan Yao's attention. After saying it, she immediately regretted it. "I should have said I was in pain," she thought. She then whispered something to Tajkis and Yin Susu. Seeing her face flush, Mei Jian and Ah Luo became curious. But then they both looked towards Qi Shengniang's clothing in the back, then giggled. "Ooh... so that's what it is..." Ah Luo mumbled, taking Qi Shengniang's and Yin Susu's hands and leading them away, saying with a smile to Fan Yao, "Our Qi Shimei is growing up. It's nothing serious."

Not understanding, Fan Yao asked again after the three women left, "What was that really about? Qi Shimei took Cheng Kun's palm strike with her own. I'm worried she has internal injuries. That man's internal energy is incredibly powerful!"

Tajkis smiled faintly. "Believe me, she's fine. It's a woman's matter, you wouldn't understand," she winked her beautiful eyes, glancing at Mei Jian, before continuing, "Your concern is sweet. Er Shige, this is the kind of problem that men usually 'don't want to know' about; you just need to know it'll be sorted out... but you'll have to propose to Qi Shimei first. I can represent her family, if necessary."

Fan Yao seemed annoyed, clicking his tongue impatiently. "Tajkis, you know my feelings..."

"Oh, you have feelings too?" Tajkis interrupted. She knew what Fan Yao wanted to say, but she deliberately avoided it, continuing lightly, "Whatever you want to do, you still need money, and now is the perfect time — especially since *Da Shige* isn't here."

Quietly, Mei Jian, listening from a distance, was amused. Everyone knew Fan Yao had been in love with Tajkis from the start. Unfortunately, his feelings were unrequited; Tajkis never paid him any mind. She saw Yin Susu and Ah Luo return with Qi Shengniang, who looked much more cheerful now. Meanwhile, she heard Fan Yao saying, "Don't tell me you want to go through with that crazy plan of yours!"

"Oh, why not?" Tajkis said, her tone challenging. "This is the best opportunity. Look, those families in Dadu, Kalgan[^kalgan], and Shangdu — what a waste of their wealth! Everyone's dead, who will inherit their homes, inherit their money? Wouldn't it be better if we 'managed' it?"

"Are you crazy?" Fan Yao almost shouted. "This is taking advantage of a dire situation!"

[^kalgan]: Kalgan is the historical name for the city of Zhangjiakou.

"Oh, so you want all that to be taken over by the government?" asked Tajkis. "In my opinion, the money will naturally go to the officials, whose bellies are already too big. We will enjoy a little of it too, but the rest we can distribute to anyone who needs it. Isn't this in line with the Ming Cult's teachings – that we help those who are suffering? Those families who died, hmm... I think this way, their lives won't be in vain either, even if they never helped anyone while alive." She chuckled lightly.

"What's happening?" Yin Susu asked, intrigued. "Sounds exciting."

"Tajkis wants to rob the homes of the massacre victims," Fan Yao said, laughing dryly.

"Hey, I just want to make use of their wasted money," Tajkis retorted, defending herself.

Qi Shengniang and Ah Luo exchanged glances; they immediately understood what the two were discussing.

"I don't think there's any harm in us taking a look," Yin Susu said, her eyes sparkling. "If there's really no one there, we'll just take whatever we can carry. Wouldn't it be a waste if someone else took it?"

Qi Shengniang, ever since fleeing Haengju, had been meticulously counting her remaining supplies every day. She mostly hunted to meet her own needs. Currently, her money supply was dwindling. Hearing the idea, she immediately said, "Hey, there's no harm in this! If we don't take it, certainly someone else, or bandits, will! I don't think the government is properly guarding those houses that have lost their owners either."

"If necessary, we could even stay there," Ah Luo added lightly. She had been a street vagrant since childhood before Tajkis found her, so she wasn't afraid of ghosts at all.

Seeing everyone beginning to agree with Tajkis's plan, Fan Yao then thought, "If I just let this happen, next they'll start bothering other people's houses that still have occupants. Wouldn't that damage the Ming Cult's reputation even more if we were discovered?" He then said, "Alright, but just this once. And I won't allow you to stay there!"

Not wanting to return to Kaifeng, they then immediately continued their journey to Dadu, where three houses had already lost all their occupants.

---

During the journey to Dadu, Qi Shengniang became very close with the four other girls, who were all older than her. The oldest here was, of course, Tajkis, nearly eighteen, followed by Yin Susu, Ah Luo, and Mei Jian. A year younger than Tajkis, the petite Yin Susu looked much younger. The tall Mei Jian looked about the same age as Tajkis, while Ah Luo, with her simple appearance yet beautiful figure and naturally pretty, cheerful face, looked younger than Mei Jian. With only two years difference in age, Mei Jian and Ah Luo quickly became close with Qi Shengniang. Both were orphans; Ah Luo didn't even know her parents' names, which is why she had no surname.

An old beggar found Ah Luo by the roadside when she was still a baby and raised her until she was about five years old, calling her Ah Luo because soon after finding her, he saw a Luohan fruit tree. Since the name 'Luohan' would not be funny for a girl, he only took the character 'Luo' to call her Ah Luo.

The old beggar was not a member of the Kai Pang (Beggar Gang). He later died when Ah Luo was about five, leaving Ah Luo to live as a vagrant in Jiangnan. Sleeping wherever she could, eating from people's pity, she grew accustomed to speaking roughly and fighting anyone who bothered her.

Mei Jian was somewhat luckier, though she too ended up as a vagrant in Jiangnan. Mei Jian's parents died during a war between the Chaghatai faction, led by Esen Buqa Khan, and Ayurbarwada. She didn't know why her parents had gone to Dadu and ended up caught in fierce battles along the road to Shangdu. After her parents died, a Kai Pang member rescued Mei Jian, who was nearly five at the time, and took her to Chang'an. However, Mei Jian got into a fight with young beggar boys over food and accidentally killed three of them by throwing rocks. She then became a lone vagrant until she was found by Tajkis, when she was nearly ten. At that time, Tajkis had just arrived from Persia and was on her way to Jiangnan, sent by Yang Dingtian to visit Yin Tianzheng. Yang Xiao and Fan Yao were part of that entourage, escorting Tajkis.

Tajkis's rather eccentric personality was very appealing to Qi Shengniang. Tajkis did not hesitate to share her knowledge in all matters, not just martial arts. Tajkis possessed a wealth of knowledge concerning the history of the Ming Cult, which even Yang Xiao and Fan Yao did not know.

Most special of all, for Qi Shengniang, was Yin Susu. For some reason difficult for her to explain, Qi Shengniang always felt as if Yin Susu was her biological older sister. Yin Susu taught her everything a young girl ought to know. Having lost her mother at a young age, and coming from a well-off family herself, Yin Susu easily understood Qi Shengniang. They were both the youngest children in their families. Yin Susu taught her how to cook characteristic Jiangnan dishes, and Qi Shengniang shared recipes for Goryeo dishes that they could find ingredients for there.

The four girls styled Qi Shengniang along the way. Tajkis also changed into typical Han Chinese women's attire. They worked together to transform Qi Shengniang into a woman who looked three years older than her actual age.

It turned out that all four girls were skilled at disguise and makeup. For the first time, Qi Shengniang received makeup like an adult woman. Her hair was tied in the Han Chinese style. Tajkis, the most skilled in such matters, had bought a new set of clothes that made Qi Shengniang look more like a female martial artist, allowing her to move more freely and no longer needing to hide the fact that she was a girl. Tajkis also stored away the bow and arrows that the child had been carrying. "In the Central Plains, women generally don't use bows and arrows. A short sword is more suitable for you," she said.

When she saw her reflection in the mirror, Qi Shengniang was stunned. She didn't recognize herself at all. The reflection in the mirror looked like a woman the same age as Tajkis or Yin Susu. The clothes she wore had erased any remaining impression that she came from Goryeo. Her eyes now seemed larger. Even her own family would take a moment before recognizing her.

As they prepared to depart from the inn, Tajkis said, "We've heard tales of the prowess of the Seven Heroes of Wudang, now it's time for them all to hear about the Seven Heroes of the Ming Cult!"

Internally, Fan Yao sighed. Before, they were honorable members of the Ming Cult, but now it seemed Tajkis would turn them into petty thieves.

---

### *Dadu at Night: The Plan Begins**

About ten li from Dadu's western gate, they tethered their horses at the edge of a forest, then entered the city disguised as travelers from the north, as Tajkis had suggested. Fan Yao pushed a cart himself. Their belongings consisted only of clothes and various food items, plants, and roots for medicinal ingredients, which they had actually purchased around Baodinglu. The five bodyguards accompanying Yin Susu were completely unarmed and always stayed close to Fan Yao.

Seeking a cheap inn, they only booked one room for the men and another for the women. Leaving the cart at the inn with Yin Susu's bodyguards who had followed her during their time in Kaifeng, the six of them waited until sunset and the city became somewhat quiet. They spent the entire day observing the three houses they intended to target.

As Tajkis had anticipated, these houses were only sealed, not heavily guarded. From the residents nearby, they learned that the government had concluded the incidents were the work of local bandits and had made no further decisions regarding the status of the houses themselves. Some neighbors even suspected that the incidents were related to political rivalries, given that all the deceased families were Yuan Dynasty officials.

"They weren't good official families," one resident whispered, "Often, we were overtaxed. They also previously had close ties with many Lamas."

"Very interesting," Fan Yao said, after they were alone. "Perhaps Cheng Kun is curious why the government isn't suspecting this has anything to do with the Ming Cult."

Tajkis remarked lightly, "In my opinion, Yesun Temur's view is actually very healthy. He disregards all religious celebrations, which is why the Ming Cult isn't being pursued under charges of heresy right now. Er Shige, where do you think Cheng Kun's martial arts originated, why have we never heard his name?"

Qi Shengniang chuckled. "It feels like we're competing with those Lamas; maybe they're also secretly looking for an opportunity to steal property here."

Yin Susu nudged her arm, subtly gesturing with her eyes behind them, where several people dressed in rough clothing were seen walking out of a roadside tavern. Their heads were covered with Mongolian hats, but they could still see that their heads were bald.

"Hmm, tonight... seems like it's going to be very interesting..." Fan Yao mumbled.

After midnight, they finally saw an opportunity to approach the three houses safely. Fan Yao approached the westernmost house with Qi Shengniang, Tajkis and Mei Jian approached the eastern house, while Yin Susu and Ah Luo approached the southern house.

The two Tibetan monks who had been hit looked at their companions, rather annoyed. One whispered, "At a time like this, you're still joking around?"

"Who's joking?"

Suddenly, they heard a sound from behind the main building, not very loud, but in the quiet night, a porcelain item falling from the roof would certainly startle someone stealthily breaking into another's house to steal. "Hey, what was that?"

"Let's check first," said his companion. "What if there are some guards back there?"

"Hah, those stupid guards, can't you handle them?" another friend sneered. "Let Xiaosheng go there now! All of you wait here."

He turned and went around to the back of the house alone. However, after waiting for several minutes, he didn't return. One of the ten monks began to get agitated, saying, "This is taking too long, it seems..."

"Aaahhh!" a startled scream was heard from their companion's direction behind the house, followed by the sound of breaking porcelain as before, then two loud 'Thumps!', 'Thumps!' and silence returned, before a mournful, hair-raising wolf howl echoed through the night.

Daring themselves, the other nine monks stealthily rushed to the back courtyard of the house, moving along the western side.

Upon reaching the rear courtyard of the main building, they saw no sign of their companion. The broken pieces of a porcelain object, resembling a small jar, were clearly visible on a large rock not far from the house entrance.

"Hey, where's that idiot Dumbul?" asked one of them, who had previously been hit by Qi Shengniang's throw.

"Langna, take a peek inside the house, maybe he went in to check," another said.

Hesitating for a moment, the monk called Langna finally said to his large companion, "Goe Lang, I'll go in first, you follow behind me. This is very suspicious."

Carefully, Langna approached the quite large and tall entrance, attempting to push it open. The door creaked as it opened. But, unexpectedly, a medium-sized jar fell from above the door, hitting Langna squarely on the head and spilling its contents. Langna cursed, "Damn it! This is urine!"

Angrily, he turned to utter more curses, pointing his finger towards the dark interior of the room, but then a wooden plank swung from the left side of the door, hitting his face squarely. He immediately fainted.

Goe Lang immediately realized that the plank must have been the work of someone playing a trick on them. But the next second, he was startled by a figure that suddenly appeared, inverted, head down. The woman's long hair hung disheveled. Her face was deathly pale. The moonlight from outside revealed her tongue sticking out, with a neck that seemed to show traces of a rope strangulation mark.

Fundamentally, despite his large physique, Goe Lang had little courage. He had been scared ever since seeing Langna get hit by the jar full of urine. Now, he was startled by a sight that seemed like a vengeful ghost after suicide or execution, especially in a place that had indeed been inhabited by a large family who were all recently murdered. Instantly, his courage plummeted sharply, approaching zero. He bolted towards the courtyard where his seven companions were waiting, screaming hysterically, "Ghost... ghost!"

This time, their thin, small companion, who appeared to be the group's leader, who could be called Skamlo, said irritably, "There are no ghosts here! You're being played by someone; how can you be so foolish? There must be bandits hiding inside, trying to scare us. All of you, follow me!"

Skamlo led his seven companions, including Goe Lang, to approach the house door, bracing for the next surprise. Their fists clenched as Skamlo slowly pushed the door, which had closed again.

The door opened, revealing two figures in yellow robes standing silently facing them. Without further thought, the eight men launched their respective punches. Some aimed for the face, stomach, hands, and feet, intending to incapacitate these tough opponents as quickly as possible.

To their utter shock, the two figures offered no resistance whatsoever. All attacks landed squarely on their targets. While they were still stunned, after realizing that their 'opponents' were actually Langna and Dumbul, their own companions, two pairs of hands consecutively reached out from behind Dumbul and Langna. These two pairs of hands delivered continuous blows to the foreheads of each monk, then swiftly struck acupuncture points on their necks. In just five seconds, everyone had been incapacitated.

---

The house to the south was the last one Xie Xun visited. It wasn't as large as the other two. Yin Susu and Ah Luo had absolutely no difficulty clearing out all the Yuan Dynasty banknotes they could find inside. They carried two wooden chests full of gold and silver directly to the cart they had left outside the inn. Yin Susu's five bodyguards, who were members of the Ming Cult's Five-Element Banners, guarded it.

Conversely, as soon as Tajkis and Mei Jian set foot in the courtyard of the house to the east, they were immediately attacked by ten local bandits who also wanted to rob its contents.

All these people were armed with sharp weapons. Since they hadn't brought any weapons themselves, Tajkis grabbed a pair of clotheslines and used them as whips, throwing one to Mei Jian. She whispered, "These people are ruining our plan. Don't engage them, let's go!"

After that, they began to fight the ten bandits, creating a noisy commotion that immediately attracted the attention of a passing patrol. From outside, shouts were heard. Tajkis exclaimed, "Fools! You're waking up the whole city; this way, none of us will get anything!" She shouted loudly, "Here! There's a robbery in here!"

Pulling Mei Jian's hand, she then ran towards the back of the house and leaped over the wall. They failed to take anything from that large house.

---

Reconvening in front of their inn, Tajkis cursed, "Damn it! Those foolish bandits ruined everything."

Fan Yao chuckled, saying lightly, "Aren't we also bandits tonight?"

"Where did you take those Lamas?" Yin Susu asked, giggling.

"Was that Qi Shimei's or Er Shige's urine?" Mei Jian inquired.

"Er Shige's, of course," Qi Shengniang answered, bursting into laughter. Actually, it was her urine and her idea. "Er Shige tied them all together and then tied them to the house pillars."

"Our haul was quite substantial," Tajkis said, but her brow was furrowed. "I'm still annoyed, I didn't get anything this time. I could've just charged them, but their weapons made too much noise, attracting suspicion!"

"So, what do you want to do now?" Fan Yao asked. Internally, he felt this was a rather foolish question, as it was clear Tajkis wanted to repeat this endeavor elsewhere. And his guess was correct.

"We're going to Zhangjiakou now," Tajkis replied. "I'm sure it'll be the same there. The government tends to ignore these incidents. It seems Yesun Temur considers this an interesting coincidence, simultaneously cleaning up his administration, as all those who died were officials he deemed corrupt!"

Feeling that he had already committed to being a "bandit" and not wanting to disappoint Tajkis, Fan Yao finally shrugged and said, "Perhaps this will benefit many people. But why don't we just clear out the western house as well? I saw there's still so much we could take. The two of us certainly couldn't carry that much gold out."

"The Lamas you tied up will surely start shouting," Tajkis replied, "After that, we won't be safe here anymore. Besides, the city security in Kalgan is clearly looser than here. What's more, after winter, the Khagan will definitely return to Dadu! At that point, we might not have another opportunity."

This thought had not occurred to the others. They quickly exited the city gate, bringing their cart along with the five Ming Cult members who were guarding it. Purchasing several sacks of grain and other foodstuffs, they hid all the gold and silver among the provisions. They used some of the money to buy a cart pulled by two camels. They also sold their horses, replacing them with camels.

For Qi Shengniang, this was an interesting experience. She had never ridden a camel in Haengju. In this way, Tajkis was actually slowing down their journey, but simultaneously making it safer, as there were no regulations against riding camels, especially for Tajkis, who clearly wasn't Han Chinese. Along the journey, they always set aside time to practice kung fu together. Qi Shengniang's kung fu advanced rapidly since associating with Tajkis.

Midway through their journey, unexpectedly, they re-encountered the group of bandits who had thwarted Tajkis's earlier attempt in Dadu. This time, they were dressed in tattered clothes and held bamboo staffs in their hands.

"Hey, it's you guys again!" exclaimed the group leader, a man around twenty-five years old, who had previously been clearly a sword expert.

As they were currently outside the city, and the road around them was deserted, Tajkis was very pleased, saying sweetly, "What, do you want to continue our last fight?"

The other bandits now laughed at their leader. "Dage, I think this girl fancies you! Don't embarrass the Beggars' Gang; show them who they're dealing with!"

Not to be outdone, Fan Yao let out a dry laugh. "Tajkis, it's time we helped Elder Yelu Qi clean up the Beggars' Gang."

"Unfortunately, my sword refuses to be used to kill nameless people," Tajkis said flatly. "State your name if you're in such a hurry to die."

To her surprise, the bandit leader, who now openly declared his group to be members of the Beggars' Gang, cupped his hands respectfully. "I am indeed presumptuous and tired of living. My surname is Fang, commonly called Dongbai. And the lady...?"

"My surname is Guan," Tajkis said casually. "My given name is Yin, but you may call me Tajkis. Those who casually utter my full name usually die quickly."[^guanyin]

[^guanyin]: Guanyin, also known as Guan Yin (觀音), is a revered figure in East Asian Buddhism, primarily known as the Bodhisattva of compassion and mercy, and is often referred to as a goddess by some sources. Originally introduced to China as the male bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara from India, Guanyin evolved into a female figure over time, particularly in Chinese Buddhism according to some historical accounts. 

Qi Shengniang loved this style of Tajkis. She laughed internally, thinking, 'Guan Yin' is the name of a goddess highly revered by Buddhists, but Tajkis is casually using it as her own name.

Fang Dongbai's companions grew even more amused by the reply. One of them, who had a large mole on his forehead, burst into laughter. "Dage, this harlot dares to claim herself a Goddess..."

His sentence didn't finish. From atop her camel, Tajkis moved with incredible speed. Before he realized what was happening, his mouth had been slapped twice, then Tajkis returned to her camel's back, using the man's head as a stepping stone. All the others only saw a blurred purple shadow moving towards the unfortunate beggar. With a dry laugh, Tajkis then turned to Qi Shengniang, "Shimei, you saw how I did it, right? Do you want to try it now?"

"Oh," Qi Shengniang replied.

This time, they only saw a blurred blue shadow as the beggar on the left, who had previously been slapped twice by Tajkis, was now slapped by Qi Shengniang, who immediately returned to her original spot on the camel's back after using her victim's head as a stepping stone. With a cold expression, Qi Shengniang asked, "Shijie, was that correct?"

Tajkis turned to her three other martial siblings, looking up at the sky, and said coldly, "In that case, Er Shige can watch in peace. You all deal with those other minnows; I'll see what that 'Dog Fart Sword' is like." After hearing Fang Dongbai's name, she knew this man was nicknamed 'Eight Arms Divine Swordsman,' and she deliberately used the insult 'Dog Fart Sword' to provoke Fang Dongbai.

Fan Yao, upon hearing Tajkis's words, remained silent atop his camel, observing the approximately twenty enraged Beggars' Gang members. They had witnessed Tajkis and Qi Shengniang's kung fu demonstration and now surrounded the four teenage girls who had leaped down from their respective camels, swords in hand. A man in his twenties with seven bags on his back stood as the leader of his companions, who rhythmically struck the ground with their staffs. This was the opening of their widely known formation called the Dog-Beating Formation (Da Gou Zhen). This leader was clearly a Transmission Elder (Chuan Gong Zhanglao).

On the other side, despite being enraged by Tajkis insulting him with crude words, nicknaming him 'Dog Fart Sword,' Fang Dongbai, who had eight bags on his back and served as a Law Enforcement Elder (Zhifa Zhanglao), showed no emotion. He faced Tajkis calmly.

Qi Shengniang was not at all unfamiliar with this Beggars' Gang formation, as her master had explained how they worked, and she herself had even been trained by Douluo Haoyu on how to use a bamboo staff and participate in such formations. To her, if the leader standing outside the circle was disorganized, the formation would also collapse. The loud clattering of the bamboo staffs was meant to disrupt the opponent's concentration and instill fear before the fight began. She exclaimed, "Shijie, they'll circle around us before finally attacking in unison. Let's attack simultaneously at four different points!"

Having said that, she immediately charged to the right, using the Maiden of Yue Sword Style taught by her master, to stab towards the chest of an opponent passing before her, regardless of who they were. Her goal was to get out of the circle as quickly as possible to attack the Transmission Elder who was giving commands from outside the circle. As soon as she moved, Yin Susu charged forward, Ah Luo to the back, while Mei Jian charged to the left.

Yin Susu opened her attack with a lightning-fast thrust towards the throat of one of her opponents, but as she moved, her wrist flicked rapidly left and right, turning the movement into a simultaneous slash towards three opponents. This was the Yin family's sword style, taught by Yin Tianzheng.

Mei Jian, who knew that the Beggars' Gang was involved in the incident that killed her parents in this very vicinity, had secretly considered this fight an opportunity for revenge. She used the Persian sword style taught by Tajkis, utilizing her exceptional qinggong to move towards the opponent passing on her left. As her sword began to move, she rotated her wrist in the opposite direction to the group's circling movement. Horrified screams were heard as her sword simultaneously sliced off the earlobes of five opponents. Mei Jian's sword technique was completely alien to the Beggars' Gang. Her speed of movement appeared ghostly, which was indeed the effect the Ming Cult members intended to create on their opponents. The formation immediately fell into disarray on the left side as Mei Jian's opponents were severely wounded.

Ah Luo, attacking towards the rear, had also harbored resentment against the Beggars' Gang members who often bothered her on the streets since childhood. But unlike Mei Jian, she wanted to use this opportunity to play around. Ah Luo's sword style was fundamentally the same as Mei Jian's, taught by Tajkis, but having been with Tajkis longer, she had learned how to apply the same sword techniques using a staff. After successfully seizing a bamboo staff from her first opponent — the man who had a large mole on his forehead — and knocking him down, she planted her sword in the ground, laughing, and twirled the bamboo staff lightly as she said, "Your Dog-Beating Formation has already broken apart. Your training is poor; it's time to receive your punishment!" She sealed four acupuncture points on both arms and the knees of the still-stunned beggar, poking the large mole on his forehead with the tip of her staff, then moved with lightning speed towards another beggar in front of her before that beggar, who had already swung the staff in his hand, realized his target had vanished. Ah Luo's staff loudly smacked the beggar's backside, precisely directing him to receive a blow from his own companion's staff, which was aiming for Ah Luo. Inevitably, the unfortunate beggar received a strike from his own friend's staff.

Next, Ah Luo, after positioning her target with ghostly speed, moved towards the beggar who had just hit his own friend. She again smacked that beggar's backside, then pushed him towards another companion, who was swinging a staff to chase her. This beggar also ended up receiving a blow from his own friend. This sequence continued until ten beggars lay incapacitated after receiving Ah Luo's staff blows to their backsides and their own friends' staff blows to their chests or heads.

The last beggar Ah Luo struck ended up with four vital acupuncture points sealed, rendering his arms and legs immobile. With a satisfied smile, Ah Luo now stood watching the seemingly uneven battle between Yin Susu and ten other beggars. She was ready to intervene, as the fight appeared imbalanced. Yin Susu was trapped in the center and always returned to this state after managing to escape. But then, Yin Susu suddenly leaped high, moving her left hand rapidly. Ah Luo saw several extremely fine needles launch from her hand, successively targeting five opponents. These five initially didn't feel the fine needle pricks in their necks. Only two seconds later, they began to feel intense itching spreading rapidly throughout their bodies. In a panic, they started screaming, "Demoness! You used poison!"

When they heard that scream, five of their companions began to feel the same thing, after Yin Susu's hand had moved earlier when she leaped behind them.

Elsewhere, Qi Shengniang, who had initially broken through the opponent's defense on the right, had quickly managed to seal the Transmission Elder's acupuncture points with her sword hilt. The seven-bag beggar had absolutely not expected this small girl to break through so quickly. His bamboo staff was a second too late when the threat of Qi Shengniang's sword tip arrived two inches from his throat. He gasped, but then Qi Shengniang's wrist rotated, turning the sword tip into its hilt. After striking an acupuncture point on his neck, which enabled her to do so, Qi Shengniang incapacitated him by sealing several other acupuncture points on his back.

They now watched the fierce battle between Tajkis and Fang Dongbai, which was evenly matched. Fang Dongbai's nickname, 'Eight Arms Divine Swordsman,' was no exaggeration. Many times, he nearly injured Tajkis with the speed of his sword. However, although his qinggong was not weak, unfortunately, it could not match Tajkis's near-perfect qinggong. Disadvantaged in close-quarters combat that relied on hand speed, Tajkis utilized her advantage, moving around Fang Dongbai and occasionally seizing opportunities to launch thrusts or slashes from the center. If Fang Dongbai tried to break out of the circle she created, Tajkis's shadow would swiftly intercept him, with her sword aimed at his chest, then disappear, creating a new circle.

When his ears caught the pained screams of some of his other companions, after their earlobes had been cut off by Mei Jian, he leaped backward, shouting loudly, "Stop!"

Tajkis stopped moving and burst into laughter. "Alright, no need to kneel before me."

Fang Dongbai, grinning widely, adopted the surname Tajkis had used. "Miss Guan, I don't think our groups need to be enemies. If you only wish to take the wealth of those rich people, couldn't we simply divide the territory in Zhangjiakou? We could split it into four quarters; which area would you like to take?"

Now Fan Yao interjected. "Tajkis, this isn't a bad idea." He then turned back to Fang Dongbai. "Fang Zhanglao, you choose first."

"Very well," Fang Dongbai replied, pleased. "My group and I will take the southern territory."

For Tajkis, this was quite a stroke of luck. She felt that since Fang Dongbai and his group had attracted the attention of law enforcement in Dadu, the southern area would definitely be more disadvantageous for them. To expedite their escape after they were satisfied with Zhangjiakou, she then added, "In that case, we'll take the northern and western parts! From now on, we won't interfere with each other. Fang Zhanglao, I hope you can keep your word!"

Extending his right hand to gesture for Tajkis's group to pass, Fang Dongbai said, "Miss Guan — please!"
