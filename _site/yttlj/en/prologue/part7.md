## *Beshbalik, October 1327: A Little Fairy in the Western Regions*

"Caelina, time to eat, don't talk to yourself in the river!" a middle-aged man called out to his granddaughter, who was sitting by the riverbank, observing the aquatic animals darting back and forth, trying to get closer to the water's surface.

They lived in a simple wooden house on the outer ring of Beiting, in the western regions. Caelina's parents had died in a raid by Chagatai soldiers on her grandfather's hometown, about a hundred *li* north of their current residence. Only the grandfather and granddaughter survived their family.

Yerkin, Caelina's grandfather, was originally from a family of Ming Jiao followers. His father, Aibek, was even appointed an official when Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty's governing system in this place, naming it Wucheng (五城), also known as Beshbalik. But because the government was unstable and constantly disputed with the Chagatai faction, most people still called their region 'Beiting', a name used since ancient times. As an adult, Yerkin himself eventually met an Eastern Church pastor and was baptized, following in his grandfather's footsteps.

After that, Yerkin also tried to work as a government official by taking the state examinations organized by the Yuan Dynasty, but unfortunately, the Chagatai faction, which more often controlled his residential area, paid no heed to this. He then considered moving to Zhongyuan, following the advice of many from his tribe. However, tragically, his son's newly married family with a child suffered a great calamity. Their village was led by a headman who tended to oppose both the Chagatai faction and the Yuan Dynasty, and eventually, the village was raided by the Chagatai, who mistook them all for Yuan Dynasty supporters. Everyone in the village was mercilessly slaughtered. Fortunately, Yerkin managed to escape with Caelina.

They were eventually saved by an old Latin Church pastor who had lived there since Marco Polo returned to Venice. The pastor had originally come when he was young, with Marco Polo's entourage. This pastor eventually baptized Caelina. When the old pastor himself finally passed away, Yerkin occupied his simple dwelling with his granddaughter. He lost interest in going to Zhongyuan after hearing about the constant disputes between factions there.

Currently, while enjoying lunch with her beloved grandfather, who was her only family, Caelina took a round loaf of bread baked by her grandfather, filling the center with pieces of lamb, and said cheerfully, "Yeye, the Memet family across the river just found two baby boys. They adopted them, but gave them Han names. Isn't that funny?"

Her grandfather laughed. "Perhaps someone left their children there, but left a note saying the children were of Han descent. It's possible, why not? Xiao Xiannu[^xiao-xiannu], have you seen them?"

[^xiao-xiannu]: Xiao Xiannu (小仙女), "Little Fairy".

"Yes," Caelina replied, laughing and showing her neat, white teeth. Her sparkling eyes and cheerful demeanor always comforted Yerkin. Caelina seemed like a little fairy far removed from this world, as if she had come from a fairy tale, which is why he sometimes called her 'Xiao Xiannu'. "They do look like Han children, but their noses seem big, and their eyes are big too, just like Yeye!"

Yerkin laughed again, this time truly amused. "So you think all Han children have small eyes and noses? Next time, Yeye will take you to Quanzhou; there you'll meet many children just like them." He concluded that the found children must be from mixed families of Han and Western Region descendants, Persian or Arab. Many such families were found in Quanzhou. One of their neighbors also came from there, with characteristics similar to what his granddaughter described.

"Quanzhou?" Caelina repeated, full of curiosity. "Isn't that in Zhongyuan? Yeye, how about we go there tomorrow?"

"Caelina," her grandfather said, smiling, "Zhongyuan is very far from here." He sighed, then continued with a look of relief, "Thankfully, that way we'll be safe... But Yeye is getting old now, maybe another time, if some of our family comes to visit, you can go there with them. But would you have the heart to leave Yeye alone here?"

Caelina shook her head. "No, Hai'er will not leave Yeye! Yeye must come too, or Hai'er won't go." She then returned to her new baby friends, "Yeye, unfortunately, that family intends to send both children to Shaolin[^shaolin], they said it was to protect them later."

[^shaolin]: The Shaolin referred to here is the Shaolin in the western regions, not the Shaolin in Henan.

"Xiao Xiannu," her grandfather said, holding back a smile, recalling something that now made him feel protected himself. "There is nothing that truly guarantees one's safety. That's why Allah says in the holy book, 'For when I am weak, then I am strong.'[^quote-1] Because the one who made everything under this heaven is Allah. He is far greater than everything else. So, if we seek refuge in Allah, who else can harm us?"

[^quote-1]: Yerkin in this instance is quoting the Apostle Paul's letter in 2 Corinthians 12:10.

But as he said it, he realized his granddaughter was still too young to understand what he was saying. He then smiled when he saw Caelina looking at him with questioning eyes, asking, "Yeye, does that mean Allah is bigger than this mountain?"

"Oh, of course," Yerkin replied. "This mountain is just one of His creations."

"Yeye says Allah can raise the dead," Caelina said again. "Why doesn't Allah raise father and mother?"

Yerkin now fell silent, for he truly didn't know how he should answer this seemingly simple question. But he knew clearly about another version of 'resurrection' that was currently happening, not too far from here. The Chagatai faction was now supporting another candidate leader, one of the sons of Khayishan, the deceased Yuan Dynasty Emperor and Great Khan, who had a completely different political alignment from the current emperor. Kusala, the person they supported, had a very charismatic personality—attracting many of his father's supporters. For Yerkin, this kind of situation could be a good thing, but it could also be the seed of disaster for many.

Initially, Yesun Temur would, of course, appoint his own son as crown prince, his future successor. But, currently surrounding him were quite a number of generals who were actually loyal supporters of Khayishan and Ayurbarwada. Even now, these people were deeply dissatisfied with Yesun Temur's 'allocation of shares,' which prioritized Christians and Muslims, like Daulat Shah and his companions. One could immediately guess what would happen after Yesun Temur himself eventually passed away. At present, Dagi was already dead, but Yesun Temur's own empress, Babukhan, was just as ambitious as Dagi!

At this point, Yerkin unconsciously made the sign of the cross while praying silently. He murmured, "Xiao Xiannu, Allah does raise the dead... so your father and mother will surely rise too... though Yeye doesn't know when they will rise..."
