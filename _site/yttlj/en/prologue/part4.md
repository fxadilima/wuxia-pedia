# Prologue
## *Henan, July 1327: The Hunyuan Thunderbolt Hand*

Initially, Qi Shengniang wanted to help Yin Susu and get to know the girl. However, with Wang Jeong also present in Kaifeng, she lost interest in that. "At least I left a useful message," she thought. Somewhat disappointed, she then decided to go to Jiangnan or some other place that caught her eye.

As she was pondering where to go, she saw a large crowd gathered in the courtyard of a luxurious house. Many soldiers were also present there. It seemed an important event had attracted their attention. From whispers among the townsfolk, she gathered that a terrible incident had just occurred at the house.

To a middle-aged woman in the crowd, she asked, "Ayi (Auntie), what happened?"

Without saying anything, the woman just pointed her finger towards the western wall of the house, where soldiers were gathered, examining something on the wall. Feeling very curious, Qi Shengniang approached, but one of the soldiers on duty stopped her, saying, "Hey, this is no business for a child. Don't come closer!"

However, at that moment, the soldiers huddled near the wall turned to move elsewhere. Qi Shengniang managed to read an inscription on the wall, seemingly written in blood, accompanied by several handprints: "*Hunyuan Pili Shou* (Primordial Unity Thunderbolt Hand) Cheng Kun killed these people."

Qi Shengniang's brow furrowed. "Who would kill so many people and then leave their name there? There's definitely something wrong!" She herself had only killed two imperial soldiers, and she was forced to flee to Zhongyuan! Judging by the number of law enforcers present, it seemed the entire household was dead. "Who is this 'Cheng Kun'? His title is so grand â€” Thunderbolt Hand! Shifu never spoke of him."

One of the men standing near her was talking to his friend, "Something like this also happened in Ling'an. The message was exactly the same!"

Another person chimed in, "My brother lives in Sichuan. He said it happened there too; now I'm seeing it for myself."

"My friend said the killer used the Qi Shang Quan (Seven Injury Punch) from the Kongtong Sect!" another person stated. "If this one's the same, then it's the same killer."

"How would your brother know that? Do these government investigators know anything about Qi Shang Quan or the Kongtong Sect?"

"The Kongtong Sect itself participated in the investigation in Sichuan," the first man said. "They then denied that they did it!"

"Hmm," Qi Shengniang thought. "They might confiscate people's weapons, but something like this can still happen, without using any weapons at all!" She suddenly grew very curious, wanting to know more about this matter. Then she suddenly recalled the conversation between Andreas and his friend in the tavern a few days earlier. "This seems like a very evil martial art. Could it be what they called the Mo Jiao...?" But then she thought again, "Didn't the Kongtong Sect themselves say this martial art originated from their sect? But what's the point of the killer leaving Cheng Kun's name?"

Suddenly, the crowd around Qi Shengniang parted, making way for a group approaching the house of the victimized family. A woman in her thirties, dressed like a nun, appeared with her disciples, most of whom were women, some men. Not all her disciples wore nun's attire. For some reason, Qi Shengniang felt an ominous aura surrounding this nun's appearance. She couldn't tell if this nun belonged to a Buddhist or a Taoist group, as both had celibate members, yet this nun's attire didn't clearly represent either. Her hair was not shaved. She held a horse-tail whisk in her right hand. This tool gave the impression that she was a follower of Taoism.

Then, secretly observing the nun's face, Qi Shengniang began to notice that the nun's eyebrows seemed to droop at both ends. This created a gloomy and cruel impression for her.

"Ssssh... Miejue Shitai (Abbess Miejue)..." whispered one of the men nearby. "Don't look at her like that, she'll kill you. She's very cruel."

"Oh," Qi Shengniang said curtly, turning her face away.

The woman called Miejue Shitai briefly observed the inscription on the western wall of the house from a distance, then snorted, said something to her disciples, turned, and left the place without doing anything.

After she left, the man who had whispered to Qi Shengniang earlier spoke again, "They must be in a hurry, wanting to know what will happen. A fierce fight between the Mo Jiao and the Emei Sect is about to occur."

Hearing the term 'Mo Jiao,' Qi Shengniang became very interested. She turned, now noticing that the man who said it was not old, around his thirties, with a medium build and a friendly face. She smiled, asking in a casual tone, hiding her curiosity, "Dage (Big Brother), how do you know?"

The man scrutinized her attire. Apparently, hearing Qi Shengniang's tone, he again thought she was from Jiangnan, and had come here merely to sightsee or was sent by her master on a task in Kaifeng. Qi Shengniang's current clothes were indeed like those of a young Wulin martial artist. She also tried to imitate a boy's voice. The man said, "Didn't your master tell you? Guhongzi challenged Yang Xiao. They will fight outside this city. I suppose Miejue Shitai appeared here also because she wants to watch that fight; that's why she ignored this matter, perhaps deeming it trivial."

"Oh," Qi Shengniang said, unable to contain her curiosity any longer. "Do you know where they will fight?"

"Well, let's head out the west gate now," the man said, gesturing for Qi Shengniang to follow him.

Qi Shengniang had never heard the names Yang Xiao or Guhongzi, but hearing the man's tone, she concluded that Yang Xiao must be a disciple of the Mo Jiao, perhaps even a high-ranking official. Guhongzi, on the other hand, was most likely a disciple of the Emei Sect. She grew curious about what this impending battle would be like.

Following the man's steps, she arrived at a pine forest on the outskirts of Kaifeng. It was already growing dark, but the moonlight was bright enough for them to see what was happening around them. Unfortunately, no one else was present yet at this location.

"Dage (Big Brother), are you sure they'll fight here?" Qi Shengniang asked.

The man smiled, pointing to their left. A group of people was stealthily approaching and observing the same open field. It was indeed Miejue Shitai and her disciples. Grinning widely, the man whispered, "Don't move recklessly, or we'll be discovered. I don't know your name yet, but my surname is Yue, and my given name is Sanguo."

"Oh, my surname is Qi," Qi Shengniang replied, returning his smile. "You can call me Sunyuan." She was forced to lie. Of course, she couldn't say her name was 'Shengniang,' which was clearly a girl's name.

"Ah, Qi Xiongdi (Brother)! I guessed it, you really are from the south," Yue Sanguo said cheerfully. He patted Qi Shengniang's shoulder rather hard, causing the small girl to cough. "My apologies, I forgot you're still small!" Yue Sanguo said, laughing. "Hey, why are you in this place? Shouldn't life be much more pleasant in Jiangnan?"

Qi Shengniang was a bit surprised by this question, but immediately said, "Dage, to be frank, I just killed a soldier in my hometown. I'm surely being hunted now, so I fled without a clear direction. They wanted to capture me for no reason; of course, I resisted. I stabbed one of them through the chest until he died, and the other wanted to seize my hand, so I slashed his neck. Of course, I can't return to my hometown."

Yue Sanguo looked very surprised by that answer. "You... you killed people...? Killed Yuan soldiers?"

Qi Shengniang thought, "Basically, Goryeo soldiers are indeed under the Yuan Dynasty now. That means they are also Yuan soldiers. Well, it's too late to take it back; this person doesn't know me anyway." She said, "I was forced to, and it wasn't really intentional. They wanted to capture me; was I supposed to just stand there? Dage, don't tell me you intend to report me."

"Oh, no," Yue Sanguo replied. "Of course not. Those bastards deserved to die." He frowned, staring intently at Qi Shengniang, then asked, "But why did they want to capture you?"

Before Qi Shengniang could answer, their ears caught the sound of very subtle footsteps approaching from the front. Qi Shengniang quickly gestured for Yue Sanguo to stay quiet. Two men appeared, entering the open field destined to be their combat arena.

Moonlight illuminated the figure of a man nearing forty, of medium build, carrying a long sword that, even from their vantage point, looked very impressive to Qi Shengniang. From a distance, a certain authoritative aura seemed to emanate from the sword. Its gleam was sharp under the moonlight, even before being unsheathed. On the sword's hilt, from a distance, their eyes could read the beautifully engraved phrase, "Yitian Jian."

"Hm, 'Yitian Jian'!" Yue Sanguo whispered. "So, it's in the hands of the Emei Sect."

With that, Qi Shengniang concluded that the man carrying the sword was Guhongzi.

The second man was tall, not bulky, with a handsome face, in his early thirties, about the same age as Yue Sanguo. He carried no weapon whatsoever. His demeanor was very calm, even somewhat cold. He was dressed entirely in black, in fabric that was quite expensive, though not ostentatious.

Guhongzi looked at his opponent with a condescending tone, saying, "Yang Xiao, stop committing evil. Disband your Mo Jiao, and return to the right path. We will not extend any further issues after this."

Yang Xiao said coldly, "The right path is Ming Jiao."

Guhongzi burst into laughter. "To me, it's all the same; the way you kill people shows the true name of your sect."

"You've been saying 'Mo Jiao,' 'committing evil,' 'returning to the right path,' and now you say we kill people, do you have proof?" Yang Xiao said flatly.

"Proof?" Guhongzi repeated. "Do you think we're as foolish as those Mongols? The ones who just killed the family in Kaifeng are clearly your people. You're trying to blame Cheng Kun? We're not defending Cheng Kun, I don't even know who he is, but trying to shift blame like that is clearly childish."

Looking up at the sky, Yang Xiao said, "It's useless to talk to a fool who won't listen to explanations. Suppose you're right, now what do you want to do?"

Guhongzi raised his sword, saying, "You seeâ€”what is this? If this sword is unsheathed, it won't return before drinking human blood."

Yang Xiao laughed coldly. "You mean, you want to command that thing to kill me?"

Guhongzi grew angry, shouting, "Stop talking nonsense, prepare to meet your doom!"

He took a stance, intending to unsheathe the sword in his hand. But, to everyone's surprise, Yang Xiao's figure transformed into a blurry black shadow; he approached Guhongzi as fast as the wind, then returned to his original spot just as quickly, laughing heartily while holding the Yitian Jian which had already changed hands. He said, "You should throw this junk into a ravine so it doesn't cause chaos in the jianghu." He unsheathed the sword. Its cold, aura-filled gleam sent shivers down Qi Shengniang's spine. But it had no effect on Yang Xiao whatsoever. He threw both the scabbard and the sword, both sticking halfway into the ground.

Without another word, Yang Xiao departed, using his *qinggong* to vanish into the darkness of the night.

They both heard Abbess Miejue sigh in the distance. The Emei Sect group emerged from their hiding place and approached Guhongzi, who stood dazed, gazing at the Yitian Jian and its scabbard half-buried in the ground, a testament to Yang Xiao's formidable internal energy and Emei's tragic defeat.

Yue Sanguo gestured for a stunned Qi Shengniang to follow him away from the spot.

"No point in peeking at someone who's already lost," Yue Sanguo said with a laugh. "I didn't expect them to lose so easily. How shameful, good thing no one else saw it."

"Yang Xiao's martial arts are truly extraordinary," Qi Shengniang said, still awestruck. "His movements are like a demon's; no wonder people call their group 'Mo Jiao'."

Yue Sanguo looked at her intently, saying, "Qi Xiongdi, you'd better be frank. Don't be afraid; I'm not your enemy. You're very young, or even still a child, yet they want to capture you. This is quite extraordinary. Unless..."

Remembering Yue Sanguo's unanswered question, Qi Shengniang just laughed. She didn't know how to answer it, as she was still pondering why King Chungsuk wanted to expedite her marriage to Wang Jeong. Of course, she couldn't tell Yue Sanguo this, as it would immediately reveal her identity as someone from Goryeo. "Unless what? Dage, what are you thinking?"

Yue Sanguo sighed again, and continued, "Unless you're involved in a rebellion against the government. But considering your age, I suppose that's also quite impossible..." He looked at Qi Shengniang intently again, then asked somewhat urgently, "Qi Xiongdi, what's your connection to the Ming Jiao?"

Qi Shengniang was surprised and retorted, "Ming Jiao? You mean what they mentioned earlier? I just heard the name now. Dage, why do you think I'm a Ming Jiao member?"

"Because usually the government only arrests a Mo Jiao member like that, without further questioning," Yue Sanguo replied. "Their sect's name is Ming Jiao, but the orthodox sects in Wulin call them Mo Jiao and usually antagonize them. Because to the government their movement is suspicious, the government gladly follows the name used by these orthodox sects and calls them 'Mo Jiao'."

Only now did Qi Shengniang understand, but she immediately shook her head and said, "I'm not a Ming Jiao member. Dage, if I were a Ming Jiao member, I'd definitely admit it."

Yue Sanguo laughed. "If you were a Ming Jiao member, you'd better not admit it. They'd arrest you immediately. Qi Xiongdi, I'm not your enemy. Nor am I an enemy of the Ming Jiao or anyone else. I don't know why they want to capture you, but I think you'd best join the Ming Jiao if you want to be safe. If you're alone, sooner or later you'll be caught, no matter how good your kung fu is. Especially since you're still too young. If you join the Ming Jiao, they'll definitely train you to become a formidable person!"

Qi Shengniang wasn't interested in becoming a formidable person. Right now, she only wanted to know the fate of her family in Haengju. But she couldn't help but laugh at the comment. "Dage, hearing your explanation, I feel like you're the real Ming Jiao member."

Yue Sanguo was stunned, then burst into laughter. "Qi Xiongdi, I must admit, you are truly very clever," he said. "You guessed correctly. But I'm just an insignificant subordinate. My advice earlier was sincere; it's up to you whether you want to listen to it or not." He pulled out an identification token from his pocket and gave it to Qi Shengniang.

Qi Shengniang saw that the object was oval-shaped but rather flat, with a convex crystal in the center that had a flaming red, engraved symbol of fire. Yue Sanguo continued, "If you give this token to a young woman named Tajkis, whom you can find west of Kunlun Shan, she will definitely help you develop. Believe me, your current troubles are truly insignificant; everything will be resolved quickly."

"Who is this Tajkis?" Qi Shengniang asked.

"She's my superior," Yue Sanguo replied. "She is indeed young, and she's of Persian descent. Don't be surprised, the Ming Jiao indeed originated from Persia. But despite her youth, her martial arts are very advanced."

"But how can I reach Kunlun Shan? That place sounds very far in the western regions," Qi Shengniang murmured, deep in thought.

Seeing Qi Shengniang's hesitation, Yue Sanguo said again, "The decision is yours. Unfortunately, I currently have a task to complete in Shangdu and can't help you much. This is all I can do. It seems we must part ways now." He clasped his hands together, then added with a smile, "Qi Xiongdi, your disguise is good, but you forgot to cover your earlobes. People can still tell you're a girl."

Qi Shengniang was stunned. For several seconds, she remained silent. Finally, she exclaimed, slapping her own thigh, "Aihh! I'm so stupid! Dage... Dage...!"

But by then, Yue Sanguo was already about thirty meters from where she stood, and two seconds later, his shadow disappeared behind the pine trees. Qi Shengniang was surprised. She thought, "If an insignificant subordinate has kung fu like this, then what about Tajkis?"

A few days later, the city residents were once again bustling, gathered to watch several prisoners being paraded towards the town square. They vied with each other to throw rotten eggs and vegetables, or small pebbles, at the prisoners, cursing them harshly. Qi Shengniang finally realized that these people were accused of oppressing the populace, corruption, or other acts against the Yuan Dynasty's law.

The local people seemed to constantly praise the firm actions of General Bayan, who was apparently their governor.

In the town square, Qi Shengniang, along with the local residents, witnessed the execution. She let out a choked scream, turning her face away and closing her eyes in shock. Around her, she still heard people shouting and cursing the dead prisoners for a while. When she opened her eyes, she briefly saw Toqto'a standing with his guards not far away. He was dressed like a young Mongolian nobleman.

Qi Shengniang abandoned her intention to greet him when one of Toqto'a's guards said, "Gongzi, the Jiangjun (General) is calling you."

"Alright, I know," the boy replied, then immediately turned to leave the place.

From a distance, she secretly observed Toqto'a and his guards crossing the town square and approaching a place that seemed filled with esteemed individuals. From among those people, a tall, burly man then stood up, greeting him with a beaming face and patting his shoulder. He seemed to tell the boy to sit beside him. Soon after, he stood to say something to the person sitting behind a table, giving execution orders. At that moment, Qi Shengniang heard the town residents greet the tall, burly man with the title "Wangye," meaning 'Prince' or 'King'.

In the past, when someone was called 'Wang,' this term indeed referred to the highest ruler of a state, but ever since Qin Shi Huang established the empire in Zhongyuan, 'Wang' was a term for the highest official in a region, and did not truly mean 'King.' From this, Qi Shengniang concluded that the tall, burly man was the governor of Henan, General Bayan. Could that boy be his son? But in Qi Shengniang's view, General Bayan was a bit too young to be Toqto'a's father.

While she was still pondering this riddle, her eyes caught sight of a young woman, about seventeen or eighteen years old, passing by with two older men. At that time in Zhongyuan, many tribes from outside the Great Wall adorned cities and provinces like Henan. And the girl was dressed in what seemed to be Persian attire. Her body was slender, her footsteps very light; she seemed to be a martial arts expert, as Qi Shengniang saw a long sword hanging at her waist.

In her entire life, Qi Shengniang had never seen a woman as beautiful as the one she saw then. The girl's hair was jet black, slightly wavy and very beautiful. Her skin was pure white and as smooth as porcelain. Her face was like a delicate, small melon seed. Her eyes were dark blue, her nose thin and prominent, typical of Persians. Her demeanor was far from flirtatious, even appearing somewhat cold, although the two men with her were clearly attracted to her. Even Qi Shengniang, who didn't know them at all, could see it. Most surprisingly, one of those men was clearly Yang Xiao!

At that moment, Qi Shengniang heard Yang Xiao say in a low voice, "Fan Xiongdi (Brother Fan), I think this person is dangerous. What do you think?"

The man called 'Brother Fan' had a handsome face and was about twenty years old, making Qi Shengniang's heart pound inexplicably. The young man was staring intently at the girl walking beside him and seemed a bit startled by the question. But the next second, he replied, also in a low voice, "I think Yang Dage is being a bit too suspicious; I personally think his actions were indeed commendable. Those bastards deserved to die. No wonder the common people here praise him."

The beautiful girl said in a flat tone, "I have a feeling Yang Zuoshi is more correct. But I can't explain why. It's just a hunch."

The man surnamed Fan clicked his tongue, seemingly a bit jealous. Then he said, "Ah, Tajkis, you always defend Yang Zuoshi..."

At that moment, Qi Shengniang seemed not to hear the rest of the sentence. Unconsciously, she murmured softly, "Tajkis?"

Her voice was actually very soft, but apparently, the three people who had passed her had very sharp ears. Their steps suddenly halted, and they turned towards Qi Shengniang. Qi Shengniang inwardly groaned, "How unlucky, why am I so stupid..." She saw the girl called Tajkis look at her intently, then smile faintly, and give a subtle gesture for her to approach.

Somewhat hesitantly, Qi Shengniang stepped closer to them. But before she could speak, Tajkis grabbed her hand and whispered, "Come with us."

She suddenly felt her feet lift off the ground, and she glided as fast as the wind with the three people. Tajkis embraced her waist, and apparently, by some means, made her 'fly' with them. Within a few minutes, they arrived at a secluded place, and she felt her body gently lowered.

As soon as her feet touched the ground again, Qi Shengniang unconsciously let out a stifled sigh. Apparently, Tajkis heard it and laughed lightly, saying, "Don't be afraid, Little Miss. We won't hurt you."

Hearing that, Qi Shengniang sighed inwardly again. Apparently, Tajkis had recognized her as a girl all along. This wasn't too strange, as Tajkis herself was also a woman, but it also indicated that her disguise was very poor. In a short time, two people had easily recognized her. Not knowing how to respond, Qi Shengniang merely gave a hesitant smile without saying anything.

Tajkis looked at her with a friendly smile, then asked, "Little brother, how do you know my name? I don't think we've ever met before, have we?"

She spoke Han perfectly, without the slightest foreign accent, which was somewhat in contrast to her appearance. Hearing that, Qi Shengniang took out the token given by Yue Sanguo and said, "From the person who gave me this."

The three people stared in astonishment at the object she presented. They looked at each other, then Tajkis asked, "Who gave you this? Where is he now?"

"He said his name is Yue Sanguo," Qi Shengniang replied. "He was heading to Shangdu when we parted. According to him, he's your subordinate, on a mission."

Yang Xiao turned to the man next to him and asked, "This person is a member of the Five-Element Banner, isn't he? Who sent him to Shangdu?"

The man surnamed Fan merely raised his hand, indicating he didn't know. Tajkis said, "I sent him. I thought we really needed to know what was happening there. But I only sent him alone, so as not to arouse suspicion."

"And I suppose Yang Jiaozhu (Cult Master) also knows," Yang Xiao said flatly.

Qi Shengniang could catch the sarcasm in that tone. But then Tajkis said, "At that time, Yang Jiaozhu and also Furen (Madam, referring to his wife) happened to be next to me. Of course, they knew. Yang Dage, do you still want to ask the Cult Master directly about this?"

"Of course not," Yang Dage replied with a faint smile. "I know both of them already consider you as their own child."

"Tajkis, I think next time you should at least inform us," said the man called Fan Dage in a more friendly tone. "I think that's all Yang Zuoshi wanted to convey."

Tajkis seemed to consider the matter unimportant. She ignored the two men and turned to Qi Shengniang, smiling and asking, "Little brother, we haven't been introduced. What's your name?"

After thinking for a moment, Qi Shengniang finally decided to be frank with Tajkis and the two men. After all, she needed their help, why hide her identity? She replied, "Jiejie (Big Sister), and also both Dages, frankly, I'm not from Zhongyuan. I come from Goryeo. My name is Ki Son-yeo, but since childhood, Shifu called me Qi Shengniang."

The three were quite surprised. Tajkis asked, "Goryeo? Isn't that quite far? How did you come to Zhongyuan, then meet Yue Sanguo who was on his way to Shangdu?"

This was the second time Qi Shengniang had to answer that she had killed someone. But this time she was ready, and she was determined to be frank, so she calmly replied, "In my hometown, I killed two officers in self-defense. So I was forced to flee and arrived here. That's when I met Yue Dage."

This time, all of them were genuinely surprised. The man surnamed Fan asked, "You mean, you killed people?"

Qi Shengniang then fully recounted what had happened in Goryeo, until she finally arrived at this place and met them. The three listened carefully without interrupting, and their eyes widened even further at the end of the story. "You really killed people," Fan Dage repeated.

Yang Xiao chimed in, "Killed two peopleâ€”imperial soldiers."

To Qi Shengniang's surprise, Tajkis smiled. Her surprise seemed to have vanished. She was about to ask when Yang Xiao suddenly extended his right palm towards Qi Shengniang's face. Startled, Qi Shengniang instinctively dodged to the left without moving her feet. But then the palm changed into a backhand slap, still aiming for Qi Shengniang's head. This time, she quickly ducked her head and shifted her left foot in a semicircle to the right-back, then moved her elbow towards Yang Xiao's ribs.

"Excellent!" Yang Dage praised wholeheartedly. To Qi Shengniang's surprise, he ignored her elbow, and his right hand returned to its original position, but this time he lifted his right leg towards the little girl's knee. Qi Shengniang was shocked. She was forced to jump back two steps to avoid the hand blocking her head movement and the leg strike towards her knee.

Fan Dage burst into laughter and said, "Yang Zuoshi, aren't you ashamed to be rough with a child?"

"This child's kung fu is by no means weak," Yang Dage said with a smile. "Little sister, forgive my rudeness just now, but killing two people for a girl your age is quite extraordinary to my ears."

"In that case, from now on we'll call you Qi Shimei (Seventh Junior Sister)," Tajkis said. "Anyone who hears it will think you're our seventh junior sister of the sect." She laughed as she turned to Yang Dage on her right.

"Which is good," Yang Xiao said. "My name is Yang Xiao. From now on, we should adjust how we speak in public. Don't call me Yang Zuoshi anymore; people will easily guess our identity."

Tajkis laughed. "My name is a bit difficult to adapt to your terms," she said. "Qi Shimei, they all always call me Tajkis. If you wish, you can call me Jiejie or Shijie. I think I should also adapt to Han attire. My clothes are a bit too conspicuous."

Fan Yao seemed excited, saying, "Great! Unfortunately, we're still missing one more person, and where did your two disciples go?"

"Mei Jian and Ah Luo are currently in Jiangnan," Tajkis replied. "They're observing the activities of salt smugglers. Many of those bastards use the Ming Jiao name, isn't that very detrimental to us?"

Fan Yao cursed, "Those scoundrels in Jiangnan are difficult to manage! Those pirates must have strong supporters, but right now, we don't know who's protecting them."

Yang Xiao said, "It's clearly not Yin Tianzheng or his children. They must be competing with Yin Tianzheng in the salt business."

"How could Yin Yewang ever win against salt smugglers? They sell at incredibly cheap prices, while Yin Tianzheng stubbornly insists on only dealing in official salt!" Tajkis said, bursting into laughter.

At that time, there were two types of salt circulating in the market. "Official Salt" was taxed by the government, making it clearly more expensive. Meanwhile, "unofficial" salt was the product of coastal residents in the east, smuggled north without government permission, thus being much cheaper. In the Yuan Dynasty era, salt was a very expensive commodity. Citizens who couldn't afford it might live without salt.

"In this matter, Yin Tianzheng is right," Yang Xiao said. "Seeking trouble with the government will only harm us."

"In my opinion, you and your outdated policies sometimes harm us," Tajkis retorted. She laughed, then continued lightly, "Stealing a little from those fat-bellied rich people in the south actually benefits us, and the poor!"

"Stealing is still wrong!" Yang Xiao said with a stiff face.

"So is fornication!" Tajkis shot back, unwilling to concede. "You forbid people from stealing, but you let Yin Yewang take concubines as he pleases. You and Yin Tianzheng even condone that lecherous bastard opening brothels in Jiangnan! Don't tell me that's better than stealing from the rich and distributing the proceeds to the poor, because I don't believe it for a second!"

"What they established were gambling dens, not brothels," Yang Xiao replied flatly.

"Hmph!" Tajkis snorted. She spat on the ground. "Don't think I don't know, it's true that from the outside those places look like gambling dens. But almost all the attendants there are women, and Yin Yewang shamelessly accepts money from guests who want to 'date' those women. In doing so, you are actually truly demeaning to women! Your policy is absolutely hypocritical!"

Yang Xiao knew that what Tajkis said was true. But he also knew that these entertainment venues were merely a cover for all the Ming Jiao activities Yin Tianzheng was building to fight against the Yuan Dynasty. He couldn't forbid their activities because from these places, they could easily recruit tough prospective fighters who were currently being trained at Ming Jiao training grounds. Within a few months, they could gather tens of thousands of people. If Yang Xiao compared Tajkis's desired activities with the results Yin Tianzheng had achieved, he would choose to let Yin Yewang do what seemed wrong. He didn't want to make a decision that could damage Yin Tianzheng's further plans.

Yin Tianzheng was one of the Ming Jiao's Law Enforcement Kings, known as Bai Mei Yin Wang (White-Browed Eagle King). He was quite wealthy in the southern region. His naval fleet was very strong, and the pirates on the eastern coast highly respected them. Currently, Yin Tianzheng's forces could be said to be the strongest faction within the Ming Jiao. The one Tajkis called Yin Yewang earlier is Yin Tianzheng's eldest son, who is currently about eighteen years old. This young man is indeed a bit of a philanderer and has lavish habits that Tajkis dislikes, and at every opportunity, Tajkis will not hesitate to mock and corner him. He is the one Qi Shengniang saw in the tavern earlier.

Besides Yin Tianzheng, they still had two other Law Enforcement Kings: Jin Mao Shi Wang (Golden-Haired Lion King) Xie Xun and Qing Yi Fu Wang (Green-Winged Bat King) Wei Yixiao. These two had their own unique strengths, and their martial arts were very high, but they had no forces or disciples like Yin Tianzheng. This is why Yang Dingtian, the current Ming Jiao leader, greatly valued Yin Tianzheng.

Yang Xiao was always at a loss when debating Tajkis. He knew that Tajkis still wanted to push her idea of robbing rich people in the south and distributing some of the proceeds to the poor. But to him, such an idea was childish and also carried the risk of confronting the Yuan Dynasty government. He wasn't afraid to face the government. Meanwhile, Yang Xiao and his allies had formulated that the Ming Jiao's main goal in Zhongyuan was actually to overthrow the Yuan Dynasty. However, at present, they were far from ready to act. If Tajkis's actions were discovered, wouldn't that expose their grand objective?

For several months now, Yang Dingtian had appointed himself and Fan Yao as the Ming Cult's Left and Right Emissaries (Guangming Zuoyou Shi). In terms of position, their duties were more or less similar to the Five Wanderers (Wu San Ren) of the Ming Cult, which was to spread the Ming Cult's teachings everywhere. However, they had a special function; unlike the Wu San Ren, who primarily served as teachers or preachers, they had to be able to approach the leaders of the major martial arts sects in Wulin as friends and work together with all of them to achieve the Ming Cult's grand objective.

At present, as always, the Ming Cult was regarded as a 'Heretical Cult' by almost all mainstream sects in the martial world. How could they accomplish such a difficult task? While he and Fan Yao continued to ponder ways to approach these leaders, Tajkis kept pushing her dangerous ideas right in front of them.

Tajkis was the daughter of a Ming Cult member in Zhongyuan, who was sent to Persia by their previous leader before Yang Dingtian inherited the position. Yang Xiao didn't know the main purpose of that mission to Persia. However, that Ming Cult member from Zhongyuan later married a Persian woman, and thus Tajkis was born. After Tajkis reached adolescence, her father sent her back to Zhongyuan to join the Ming Cult here, also as a form of his responsibility for his duty at that time.

The first moment Tajkis set foot in the Ming Cult headquarters at Guangming Ding (Bright Peak), Kunlun Shan, all eyes stared at her with intense curiosity. When she unveiled her face, they all seemed to see a small pearl among heaps of black sand. Although she was only twelve years old at the time, she possessed a certain charm that made all eyes widen in admiration. Anyone who glanced at Tajkis would surely turn to stare at her longer. From that moment on, she lived at Guangming Ding, and Yang Dingtian regarded her as his own daughter, though he never officially stated this.

Needless to say, as Tajkis grew older, all the young men at Guangming Ding fell in love with her. If she happened to stroll in the nearest town, all men's eyes would follow wherever she went. If she bought something or ate at a tavern, she magically wouldn't need to pay for it. Fortunately, this didn't happen too often, as Tajkis spent most of her time at Guangming Ding practicing kung fu.

Currently, Tajkis's kung fu was exceptionally high, despite her very young age. While not considered the absolute best, she was not someone just anyone could face. Even Yang Xiao and Fan Yao wouldn't easily defeat her. Yang Dingtian personally trained her, and in addition, Tajkis always practiced the Persian kung fu passed down by her parents. That kung fu was rather peculiar, and its movements were difficult for opponents to read.

Knowing he would surely lose the argument, Yang Xiao finally decided not to engage with Tajkis's sharp comments. He pretended not to hear.

Fan Yao said, "Enough, if you two keep this up, you'll only confuse Qi Shimei; she's just joined and doesn't understand anything yet."

Qi Shengniang was overjoyed upon hearing Fan Yao's words. "So, I've been accepted as a member," she thought. She indeed didn't understand what Tajkis and Yang Xiao were debating, but she chose to remain silent and listen carefully.
