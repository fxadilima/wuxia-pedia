# Prologue
## *Shangdu, October 1328: Trapped in the War*

As it turned out, Wei Yixiao had quickly found traces of Tajkis and Fan Yao on the outer ring of Shangdu, heading northwest. At that moment, the two were relaxing, setting up camp by a small river, far from any crowds. This sight greatly irritated Wei Yixiao.

"Aiyo!" he chided, his brow furrowed. "You two, you're ordered to return to Guangming Ding immediately. They said you were rushing to Karakorum, but it turns out you're just out here romancing!"

Tajkis burst into laughter, saying lightly as she looked at Fan Yao, "Er Shige, are we really romancing?"

"I'd hoped so," Fan Yao replied, seizing the bait Wei Yixiao had thrown. But he quickly realized Tajkis had no intention of agreeing, so he hastily added, "Unfortunately, we're waiting for an opportunity to get more money here. Aren't you interested?"

"What money?" Wei Yixiao said. "Don't tell me Tajkis wanted to dance in brothels, and you're allowing it!"

Wei Yixiao could only stare, his eyes widening in disbelief as Tajkis and Fan Yao burst into laughter. They disappeared into their respective tents, only to re-emerge moments later, each struggling with a seemingly heavy chest. When the lids were finally lifted, revealing their glittering contents, Wei Yixiao's complexion cycled through a kaleidoscope of colors — yellow, then red, blue, and finally settling on a vibrant green, mirroring his robes. "This much — you got this from dancing?!" he exclaimed, aghast.

"Of course not," Fan Yao replied smoothly. "How could *I* dance? And do you really think a brothel owner would give this much money to Tajkis — no matter how beautiful she is? We took this from the abandoned homes of low-ranking officials. They fled, panicked after hearing that Orlugh Khan and Burkha Temur were moving in this direction."

"What?!" Wei Yixiao cried, even more astonished. "You mean officials actually dared to just abandon their posts and flee?"

"They certainly took some of their wealth with them, but not all of it," Fan Yao answered. "There was still a great deal left in their homes; most left in a hurry. Wouldn't it be a shame if someone else took it?"

'Any plan Yang Dingtian has right now must surely require money,' Wei Yixiao thought. If, in such a short time, these two could gather so much wealth with such ease, how could Yang Dingtian possibly refuse it? Wei Yixiao's mind raced, and he quickly supported Tajkis and Fan Yao's idea to remain longer. If war broke out, they wouldn't support any side, as per Yang Dingtian's command, which meant they wouldn't be violating any orders!

Wei Yixiao then proceeded to help the two young individuals plunder even more wealth from abandoned houses around Shangdu and Zhangjiakou.

The following month, Daulat Shah and Empress Babukhan launched an attack towards the Great Wall as a strong reaction to the actions of El Temür and his allies, who had announced the enthronement of Tugh Temür as Great Khan and Yuan Emperor, completely disregarding their earlier proclamation regarding Ragibagh's ascension.

However, on November 14, exploiting Shangdu's weakened defenses after the departure of those troops, Bukha Temur and Orlug Temur, who had just arrived, immediately surrounded Shangdu, placing the capital in a state of emergency. Even more wealthy individuals and non-military officials fled, either defecting to Dadu's side or simply seeking to save their belongings and families.

Wei Yixiao, Fan Yao, and Tajkis hit the jackpot in Shangdu. All they had to do was shift their camp a bit deeper into the forest to avoid direct encounters with Bukha Temur or Orlug Temur's soldiers, who were besieging Shangdu from the outer perimeter.

Amidst this situation, they received news from Yue Sanguo, who had now arrived in Karakorum, that Kusala's forces were approaching Karakorum with full support from the Chagatayid. Fan Yao and Tajkis weren't sure whether this news should make them happy or sad. After all, Yesun Temur, during his reign as emperor, had greatly benefited the Han people and other non-Mongolian tribes. The expulsion of a large number of Tibetan monks from Zhongyuan was undeniable proof of this.

Fan Yao stated, "Now it's not just from Dadu or the east like Liaodong. From the south, Henan is clearly held by General Bayan, then Tugh Temür has successfully gathered support from around Jiangnan, and now, from the north, Shangdu is also under pressure from Kusala, who brings the Chagatayid! Once he arrives in Karakorum, it's clear that all the Mongolian princes there will support this Khayishan family. We can be sure that Shangdu will lose this war."

"Unfortunately," Tajkis added, "Kusala's family will almost certainly side with those *Lamas*. So whoever among these brothers comes to power, they'll allow those *Lamas* back in here, and that will definitely interfere with our affairs!"

"*And disturb the people too*," Fan Yao emphasized.

They didn't have to wait long for Fan Yao's prediction to come true. The very next day, witnessing the inevitable, Yesun Temur's loyalists in Shangdu surrendered. Daulat Shah and most of the leading loyalists were captured. But Ragibagh, it turned out, was missing.

"Hmm! Missing?" Fan Yao mused, catching whispers from the soldiers celebrating their victory in Shangdu. Wei Yixiao easily eavesdropped on the soldiers' conversations using his qinggong. "Or, perhaps, already dead?"

Tajkis laughed. "Why bother thinking about that poor child? Most likely, he was killed, by one side or another. Why was he born Yesun Temur's son, anyway? One thing's for sure, I guarantee he's not the only one 'missing' right now. Are you sure *all those high-ranking officials* surrendered?"

"Definitely not," Fan Yao replied. "Surrendering means death. Not surrendering might mean survival! In other words, now there must be even more abandoned houses. Haha!"

For about a month, they dedicated their efforts to 'cleaning out' the properties abandoned by their owners in Shangdu who had fled in haste. Neither Tajkis nor Fan Yao showed any interest in collecting anything other than Yuan Dynasty currency, gold, and silver. Indeed, they could have carried even more, if not for the logistical challenge of transporting it all to Dadu and then to Guangming Ding, especially since there were only three of them.

Before leaving Shangdu, heading west to avoid a direct confrontation with Fang Dongbai's Beggars' Gang members in Zhangjiakou, they caught a glimpse of the gang arriving, plundering homes the trio had already visited. Tajkis and Fan Yao chuckled to themselves.

"Let them take the leftovers," Fan Yao said, entering the forest where they had stashed their own haul with Wei Yixiao. "I saw Fang Dongbai arguing with his own members earlier. Who knows what happened."

Wei Yixiao grinned widely. "I know about this. Fang Dongbai, after all, is a Zhifa Zhanglao (Law Enforcement Elder). It seems their members weren't just taking things from abandoned houses; they were also harassing other residents. Some were even bothering women! I see the Beggars' Gang is quite chaotic now. No longer like in Yelu Qi's time, let alone Huang Rong's!"

Wei Yixiao's words made Fan Yao and Tajkis secretly respect Fang Dongbai more. They actually wanted to help him, but they weren't willing to take such a big risk, considering the sheer amount of goods they were carrying. In the end, they took the road towards Datong to further avoid other groups. From there, they would then move east.

## *Dadu, November 1328: Profitable Chaos*

At the same time Tajkis and Fan Yao were meeting with Wei Yixiao in Shangdu, the sound of cannon fire echoed from the abandoned house where Qi Shengniang and her martial sisters were waiting with the other Ming Cult members in Dadu. This not only startled them but immediately sent all the residents of Dadu into a panic.

Yin Susu and Qi Shengniang, who had been venturing near the Great Wall, were seen sprinting back using their qinggong at high speed, shouting to everyone they met along the way, "Don't go near the Great Wall, everyone move back! The attack from Shangdu is assaulting that place; they're moving in this direction!"

Their warning immediately made everyone who had been traveling north with the intention of passing through the Great Wall abandon their plans. They turned back, heading west or east, with only a few choosing to return to Dadu.

The shops lining the streets of Dadu fell into a panic. Most quickly shuttered their doors, their owners fleeing the city, primarily heading south towards Henan. Some officials, who had previously hesitated to support Tugh Temür's enthronement and the coup orchestrated by El Temür and General Bayan, intended to mobilize their own soldiers. Some tried to see which way the wind was blowing, while others sought to turn the situation to the advantage of the attacking Shangdu faction. However, El Temür's forces quickly quelled this unrest. No one dared to move their troops without direct instructions from his side.

At this time, it wasn't just the attacking Shangdu forces firing cannons. The Dadu faction, led by El Temür, possessed far more cannon reserves. While the onslaught from Yesun Temur's loyalist forces did reach the outer ring of Dadu, in the area where the disguised Ming Cult members were staying, El Temür's troops quickly retaliated with cannon fire, disregarding the remaining civilians near the Great Wall or on the road to Shangdu. This bloody event created a terrifying atmosphere, causing even more city residents, including several low-ranking officials, to flee south with their families.

Yin Susu immediately seized the opportunity to occupy an abandoned shop. She closed all the doors and windows and gathered her three martial sisters inside. "This shop is ours now!" she declared joyfully. "I heard the owner has no intention of returning; they all fled to Kaifeng!"

Qi Shengniang cheered with delight. "We're rich overnight!" she exclaimed, rushing to check every drawer near the reception counter and the owner's desk. "Who knows if there's any money left here?"

Ah Luo and Mei Jian immediately scoured the cupboards and all other areas, including the kitchen, discovering a substantial supply of rice and other food ingredients. Yin Susu even found numerous jars of wine in what served as the storage area.

---

On their journey toward Dadu, the group unexpectedly encountered two Shaolin monks walking north from the direction of Baodinglu. Recognizing Yang Xiao, who wasn't disguised, one of the monks shouted, "Yang Xiao, we have no enmity with you, although we disagree with your teachings that use Buddha's name to attract new disciples. But why did you kill Kongjian *Dashi*[^dashi]?"

The four Ming Cult members were greatly surprised. Yang Xiao quickly said, "We don't know Kongjian Dashi at all. Why would we kill him? This must be a misunderstanding, as we weren't even aware that Kongjian Dashi had passed away."

[^dashi]: Dashi (大師), "Grand Master." This term is generally used to address a monk considered to be of a higher standing than average, though it can also be used for other monks deemed worthy of respect.

Hearing Yang Xiao's denial, the monk grew even angrier, shouting, "Yang Xiao, still want to deny it? On a tree, there's an inscription just like in other places where Xie Xun killed people: 'Hunyuan Pili Shou[^hunyuan-pili-shou] Cheng Kun killed this person.' Or now you want to deny that Xie Xun is a Ming Cult member too?"

[^hunyuan-pili-shou]: Hunyuan Pili Shou (混元霹靂手), "Primordial Thunder Hand."

This was the umpteenth time Yang Xiao had faced someone saying the same thing, but this time he knew what truly happened, directly from Xie Xun's own mouth. He hadn't yet heard Fan Yao's story, who had met Cheng Kun directly with Qi Shengniang, but he knew that the person referred to was Xie Xun's master.

Sighing deeply, he said, "With great regret, we must admit that Hunyuan Pili Shou Cheng Kun is indeed the martial arts master of the Golden-Haired Lion King, Xie Xun, one of the Ming Cult's law enforcers. However, this person massacred Xie Xun's own family. We are still investigating the entire story to uncover the truth. So I can only promise that we will inform Shaolin about the progress of our investigation." He clasped his hands respectfully. "Please leave your names, so I can state that we have heard this report directly from you."

Angrily, the two monks replied, "My name is Yuan Yin, and this is my martial brother, Yuan Ye!" Yuan Yin then continued, flicking his sleeve, "Very well, we await your arrival at Shaolin! We will report your words to our abbot!"

Without another word, the two monks departed, heading north. To avoid another encounter with them, Yang Xiao suggested his companions rest for a while at a nearby inn, as the two monks also seemed to be heading towards Dadu.

Tajkis asked, after ordering food and wine for everyone, "Da Shige, this is completely disadvantageous. It seems this problem will grow bigger in the future. How will we answer people's questions later?"

"That's why Shifu ordered all of you to report immediately," Yang Xiao replied, sighing again. "Xie Xun has indeed been handled by Shifu himself, but his illness is difficult to cure. We know he did all that unconsciously, but we can't just say that and expect others to believe it! Considering the current political chaos..." He stopped, seeing Fan Yao's hand gesture, directing his eyes towards a table to their right, where several people were discussing with slightly raised voices. Apparently, one of them was reciting a poem, repeated several times, to clarify its meaning.

"Listen closely, the first part, 'Wulin Zhizun, baodao tulong'[^tulong]..." Fan Yao whispered, "while the second part concludes with 'Yitian bu chu, shuiyu zhengfeng?'[^yitian]... if this doesn't symbolize those objects, then what does it?"

[^tulong]: Wulin Zhizun, Baodao Tulong (武林至尊，寶刀屠龍), "The Supreme Martial Realm Lord, the Treasured Saber Slaying the Dragon."
[^yitian]: Yitian bu chu, shuiyu zhengfeng? (倚天不出，誰與爭鋒？), "If the Heavenly Sword does not emerge, who dares contend against it?"

"But this could mean..." another person at the nearby table said in a low voice, inviting everyone to lean in closer. "The person who is in Karakorum... is fighting against the 'Will of Heaven,' which is now in Dadu..."

"Aren't they brothers?" another argued.

"Yes, but the older brother is very strong; look, even the Chaghatayid support him!" his friend countered. "While this younger brother, it seems, only relies on the 'Will of Heaven'..."


---

Continuing their journey, they swapped Yang Xiao's horse for a new camel. Then, they saw Fang Dongbai from a distance, running with his qinggong, coming from the opposite direction, seemingly heading towards Henan. Yang Xiao had met Fang Dongbai before and had exchanged a few moves with him, resulting in a draw. He whispered, "Isn't that Fang Dongbai, the Zhifa Zhanglao (Law Enforcement Elder) of the Beggars' Gang? Don't let him recognize us, let's move behind that tree!"

Watching Fang Dongbai's speed from behind the tree, they could see the direction he was heading. Tajkis lightly commented, "It seems Bayan has called him, so the person you're looking for could very well be Fang Dongbai."

"But El Temür must have sent someone else," Fan Yao said. "I'm starting to feel that the real 'Dragon' fight is between El Temür and General Bayan!"

"You're imagining too much," Wei Yixiao chuckled, "they're clearly allies!"

"They were," Fan Yao retorted, "After this, who knows?"

Walking somewhat leisurely, they finally arrived in Dadu five days later, finding the abandoned house guarded by only five members of the Ming Cult's Five-Element Banners. No other Ming Cult members were visible there.

Xin Ran, a member of the Fire Banner, said, "They are all staying at the new inn."

"The new inn?" Fan Yao asked, "What inn? Whose is it?"

"Ours, of course," Tajkis said with a laugh, having already guessed what happened. "You think only Shangdu can be scared into abandonment? It's clear many people in Dadu have evacuated elsewhere."

"Xin Ran, take us there," Yang Xiao said.

Unloading all their goods, they then led their camels into the city. Tajkis and Fan Yao were astonished to see Ah Luo, Mei Jian, and Qi Shengniang standing in front of an inn, wearing outfits similar to waitresses, offering the inn's specialty dishes.

At this moment, they observed residents around the inn gathered, reading an official imperial announcement. Its content attempted to reassure the capital's populace, urging everyone to work as usual, because although they still faced warfare, the attack from outside the Great Wall had been successfully repelled before reaching the city.

Most of the people crowding to read the announcement seemed doubtful. However, since they were street vendors and common folk, most of whom had no other place to live, they eventually paid little heed to the announcement.

"If this news can be believed, then we don't have much time left," Tajkis whispered to Fan Yao. The inn they were managing was currently bustling with customers. The newly arrived Ming Cult followers were helping with the inn's activities, so Tajkis, along with Yang Xiao, Fan Yao, and Yin Susu, had the opportunity to observe what was happening in the city.

"Nothing is certain yet," Fan Yao countered. "Think about it, if too many people leave, or are afraid to go out and sell, then the capital's daily life will be severely disrupted. That's why the government issued an announcement like this."

"But the attack from the north itself has indeed been suppressed," Yang Xiao stated. "We saw it ourselves; since yesterday, activities around the Great Wall have returned to normal. They just need to clear away the bodies of the cannon explosion victims."

"One thing is certain: Tugh Temür will still be enthroned as emperor," Fan Yao added. "I just heard someone say it in the crowd. So, Dadu's side definitely won't back down. This is because Kusala was previously out of reach, not because of anything else."

Tajkis laughed, "Don't tell me you're that naive, truly believing everything they announce. He became emperor is..." She leaned her face close to Fan Yao's, "because he is easier to control, just as you can be controlled by me," she winked, continuing, "Of course, I wouldn't choose Da Shige, who tends to contradict me, let alone Shuobude Dashi!"

"In this matter, I don't mind you controlling me, Tajkis," Fan Yao replied, grinning widely. "Unfortunately, you're never truly serious about this. How about we stop talking about this annoying politics? Let's contact your parents as soon as possible..."

Tajkis ignored his last remark, waving to Qi Shengniang who greeted her from a distance, then turned to Yin Susu, "Our little sister here will be disappointed if she hears Er Shige's words, don't mention that topic again."

"If Tugh Temür ascends the throne, won't there be major reforms?" Yin Susu asked. "I heard from Father that he was educated in the same way as the Han people. He studied all of Confucius's teachings and our traditions."

"Huh, you think it's that easy?" Yang Xiao scoffed. "Tugh Temür is not a formidable military man. In this situation, if he ascends the throne, it's the same as El Temür or General Bayan ascending. The real power will remain in the hands of one of them. And neither of them will support Tugh Temür's ideas. On the contrary, what we will see is precisely a traditional Mongolian government."

"But I think General Bayan's actions in Henan are correct," Fan Yao interjected. "Corrupt officials or those who oppress the people deserve to be eliminated!"

Tajkis said, "Er Shige, look closely, all the people executed in Henan, they all turned out to be Han people. Don't tell me you truly believe that officials who are not of Han ethnicity are completely free of corruption or oppressing the people."

Fan Yao was startled. For a moment, he didn't reply. After a while, he finally said, "I'm only realizing this now. Perhaps he hasn't found evidence to punish the others. Or perhaps it was just a coincidence that only Han people were caught at that time. I think..."

Yang Xiao gestured for them to be silent. A group of soldiers on horseback were patrolling and passed by them, shouting for the path to be cleared. Pedestrians quickly moved aside to widen the road. A shabby-robed monk was pushed by the crowd towards Fan Yao. He clasped his hands in greeting when the situation calmed down, "Amituofo! What joy is there in this life, and what difficulty in death?"

"Peng Dashi," Tajkis whispered. "It's good to see you here."

The monk, who was indeed Peng Yingyu, immediately bowed his head as a signal for them not to speak too much there.

"Dashi, I hope you would grace our inn with your blessings," Yin Susu said, subtly disguising Peng Yingyu's presence from other patrons.

They quickly returned to the inn with Peng Yingyu, then led him to the kitchen to speak more quietly. Behind the kitchen was a spacious terrace, complete with a round table and several chairs where they could converse at ease, while their other comrades were busy serving the inn's customers.

Yin Susu retrieved a pot of green tea and several warm mantou for Peng Yingyu.
