# Prologue
## *Dadu, 1326: The Leopards of Ulug Ulus*

In Dadu, Yesün Temür gazed at a group of large, magnificent leopards sent to him from Ulug Ulus, laughing heartily. He turned to Daulat Shah, "Look at these gifts from Ozbeg. What do you all think they mean?"

Daulat Shah, suppressing a shiver at the sight of the leopards' fangs, grinned widely. "Surely, it means they fear Huang Shang."

Nearby, Ubaidullah and Bayanchar, who had come into good fortune after Sidibala's death and were now seated in the Zhongshu Sheng, grimaced, trying to hold back gasps as the leopards bared their teeth before their faces.

"So," Yesün Temür continued, though he knew what the three sycophants before him would answer, "how do you think we should repay their kindness?"

Shrugging, while glancing at Bayanchar and Daulat Shah, Ubaidullah casually remarked, "Just give them a little money, gold, and silver. They'll obey all of Huang Shang's subsequent commands."

Tossing a lump of meat into the cage of one of his new leopards, Yesün Temür smiled faintly. "Ubaidullah, if you eat too much sugar, your mouth will certainly be sweet, but for others, it's rather bothersome — it *stinks*!" He extended another lump of meat towards Bayanchar. "Give this to my good friends here." He then turned to Daulat Shah, "That's fine, but only half the amount you're thinking of."

He knew there was a bad habit of wasteful spending within his ranks at the moment, buying expensive stones imported by foreign merchants and sold here at ten times their original price. He also knew perfectly well that many poor people were starving in the southern regions. He deeply detested such practices.

Hearing the decision, Daulat Shah, Ubaidullah, and Bayanchar immediately bowed respectfully, assenting, and prepared to leave. But Yesün Temür raised his hand. "Hey, one more thing. From now on, don't buy those extremely expensive stones anymore! And I also officially forbid Lamas (Tibetan monks) from entering here starting now. Prepare an official announcement for this. They only add to the chaos and damage the reputation of the Yuan Dynasty!"


## *Haengju, May 1327: A Change of Plans*

Currently, every year, Goryeo was obligated to send their finest daughters to the Yuan Dynasty. In return, the Yuan Dynasty would marry a palace princess to the reigning Goryeo crown prince or king, to strengthen familial ties and simultaneously control Goryeo. King Chungsuk, who had lived in Dadu for quite some time, had learned what other kingdoms usually did to avoid this obligation. He didn't want to send one of his own daughters to Dadu and sought a suitable replacement to send there instead.

After reviewing several names, he finally arrived at the family of Ki Ja-oh, who had temporarily postponed the engagement between their daughter and his son, Wang Jeong. He found the solution he was looking for and then wrote an imperial decree to be sent to Ki Ja-oh.

Unbeknownst to his father, Wang Jeong, who had a loyal eunuch, caught wind of his father's plans. As the dispatched envoy set off, he also sent another group of envoys, who arrived earlier at the Ki Ja-oh family residence, carrying a forged imperial decree by Wang Jeong himself, to be read aloud by his eunuch.

Ki Ja-oh, startled to see a retinue from the palace arrive at his residence with a carriage and an official decree, knelt to listen, his heart filled with trepidation.

"Considering the increasing urgency for the crown prince's enthronement as King of Goryeo," the eunuch's voice boomed as he read, "...we have decided to accelerate the crown prince's marriage plans, and with this... we send an envoy to escort the daughter of the Ki Ja-oh family to the palace... Thus is the King's decree..."

Barely trusting his own ears, Ki Ja-oh was still processing the words when suddenly his daughter, who had been kneeling alongside him, rose to her feet, declaring loudly, "I don't want to!"

Her father and all her elder brothers immediately gestured for her to be silent and return to her kneeling position, but Ki Son-yeo ignored them all.

Instantly, the eunuch and all the guards present glared at Ki Son-yeo with reproach. Before a decree was fully read and accepted by its recipient, no one was permitted to stand, let alone speak as they pleased! But this young girl defied it without hesitation. The eunuch sternly rebuked her, "Watch your conduct! You are in the presence of His Majesty himself!"

To everyone's astonishment, Ki Son-yeo, who should have been trembling with fear in their eyes, turned, snorted, and began to walk away from the courtyard, heading towards the road leading to the open field. The eunuch immediately shouted, "Seize her!"

At once, chaos erupted in the courtyard. Several guards moved to apprehend Ki Son-yeo, but they also hesitated, remembering they were about to seize a girl no more than eleven or twelve years old; how could they use force? Before they decided precisely what to do, Ki Son-yeo's foot moved, kicking the face of the soldier in front of her. Surprised, and not expecting the girl to be capable of such a move, the kick struck true, sending the soldier sprawling. Three other soldiers immediately realized that this young girl was not to be underestimated. They began to surround Ki Son-yeo from three directions.

The subsequent events were truly beyond the expectation of Ki Ja-oh and Ki Son-yeo's own brothers. After snatching the long sword from the soldier she had just knocked down, Ki Son-yeo then used the sword to unleash the Yue Nu Jian Fa she had diligently practiced for the past few years. But this time, what she held was not a wooden sword, nor the short dagger she had stolen from her brother, but a palace guard's sword! Leaping high, she rotated her waist, her right leg sweeping another soldier who was moving closer, while her sword spun in the opposite direction of her leg's movement, slashing towards another soldier. The first soldier collapsed from the sweep of her leg. Unfortunately for the second soldier, the sword cleanly sliced his throat. His blood spurted, staining Ki Son-yeo's face, who was momentarily stunned by the consequence of her own action.

Ki Ja-oh and Ki Son-yeo's other siblings shrieked in horror. But the next second, while everyone was still in shock, Ki Son-yeo, exerting her qinggong, leaped over the courtyard wall and out, after slashing the neck of another soldier who was standing near the wall she was about to jump over.

"Quick, chase her!" the eunuch cried in a panic.

All the soldiers scattered outside to pursue Ki Son-yeo. At that moment, Ki Ja-oh said in a low voice to Ki Ch'ol, "Take plenty of gold, tell your sister to get out of Haengju! Quick, don't waste time!"

The situation became uncertain. Only Ki Ch'ol disappeared from the commotion, while the others pretended to join the pursuit of Ki Son-yeo, following the royal soldiers. Ki Ja-oh knew his daughter had escaped, taking his beloved horse. He didn't know for certain which direction the girl was heading.


## *Dengzhou, June 1327: A Little Fairy Lands in the Wine Shop*

Ki Son-yeo's journey to Shandong took about ten days. But as soon as her ship departed, her mind gradually calmed. The sea breeze on the deck greatly helped her piece together what had happened, leading to her being on this ship.

First, the decree read by the eunuch now struck her as highly suspicious. Why would King Chungsuk suddenly expedite his marriage to Wang Jeong? They were roughly the same age, both barely twelve years old; there was no reason to rush a marriage! And furthermore, why was there an announcement that Wang Jeong would ascend the throne? King Chungsuk had only recently returned from Dadu; would he now abdicate? It seemed almost impossible; this must be a mistake. Or not a mistake, but a trick! Who would dare to do it? And for what purpose? For now, she kept all these questions to herself.

Upon her first steps in Dengzhou, Ki Son-yeo's immediate thought was to find Douluo Lian and Yang Dao, who lived in Qufu. She quickly changed into a set of blue men's clothing she had just bought at a nearby ready-to-wear stall. The women's clothes Ki Ch'ol had given her felt very uncomfortable, while the clothes she was now wearing were those she had stolen from the village near Haengju. She needed to look just like the local inhabitants.

Fluently, she asked the clothes seller, a somewhat plump middle-aged woman, for directions to Qufu. The woman smiled kindly, commenting, "Guniang (Miss), you'd best go home to Jiangnan soon. There are some unpleasant rumors here. You're making your parents worry."

Feeling somewhat surprised, Ki Son-yeo thought, "Do I look like someone from Jiangnan?" But she returned the smile, saying truthfully, "Ayi (Auntie), my mother has passed away. I truly wish to find my relatives living in Qufu. Can Ayi show me the shortest way there?"

"Oh, poor child," the woman said. "Qufu isn't too far, but you must head south again. If you wanted to go to Qufu, why come to Dengzhou? Someone must have deliberately led you astray." But then she noticed the long sword in Ki Son-yeo's left hand and realized that this child must be the daughter of a southern martial artist family, which was why she wasn't afraid to travel far alone.

Taking deep breaths of fresh air to fill her lungs, Ki Son-yeo now began to sense the distinct atmosphere around her. The weather here was very hot for her. They were indeed entering summer. She stopped at an inn to fill her stomach, ordering a bowl of noodles with pork, and choosing a table by the window.

Near her table, several young men in their twenties were joking about what they called the 'Jiu-zhong Ba Xian'—the Eight Drunken Immortals. She had heard this story from her master. Douluo Jing had jokingly compared himself to He Xiangu. Thinking of this, she grew sad. Her uncle-master must be very worried once he hears about what she has done.

---

While eating the noodles that she found very delicious, she suddenly thought, if she were to meet Uncle Yang and Aunt Lian now, what if the Goryeo people found out? Wouldn't that drag her uncle and aunt into trouble? She then hardened her heart, making up her mind, "I must not go to Qufu!"

Then a new thought began to arise, where should she go? The next second, the question was immediately answered. She was now a fugitive from the Goryeo government, but at the same time, she also *free*! She could go wherever she wanted. Didn't the cloth-selling auntie think she was a Jiangnan person? Then he would go to her 'hometown'!

At the two tables to her right, she saw a young man of about eighteen with luxurious and striking clothes talking to several people, who seemed to be his subordinates. They all held swords, which were currently placed on the table. Unintentionally, Ki Son-yeo's ears heard the young man say something in a rather loud voice, as if he was surprised, with an unhappy tone, "Kai Pang? What are they doing here? Get rid of them!"

Ki Son-yeo was very surprised. Her teacher was from Kai Pang, why did these people seem hostile to Kai Pang?

Next, one of the young man's subordinates, who seemed to be middle-aged, said in a low voice, but Ki Son-yeo's ears could still catch what he said, "*Gongzi*, Laoye sent us to Jiangling, there's no need to bother with these little thieves. The art exhibition is much more important..."

"Oh!" said the young man. "Where is father now?"

"On the way back from *Guangming Ding*," replied his subordinate, in a casual tone, "*Xiaojie* sent the news from Jiangnan."

"Little thieves?" thought Ki Son-yeo, "They think Kai Pang is just a little thief? Who are these people?"

Then she saw the handsome young man snort, laugh lightly, and say in a disdainful tone, "You guys also follow my sister like that? Then what is that brat doing now?"

"*Xiaojie* is on her way to Henan," his subordinate replied again, "This still has something to do with the matter in Jiangling. So we should hurry there, let *Xiaojie* take care of the Henan matter."

"Oh, is that so?" said the young man, seemingly a little surprised, "Susu is also involved in this big matter? It seems that father is a little reckless. What if she makes a mistake?"

"In that case, no, Xiaojie is only in charge of delivering the goods to Kaifeng," said another subordinate, "Laoye has already taken this kind of thing into account. If only we deliver, the impression will be different. If Xiaojie appears there, then people will feel that we respect them. Moreover, Xiaojie is not alone, fifty people are guarding her from afar."

"I understand," said the young man, smiling faintly. "Alright, let's go now."

Now Ki Son-yeo had two choices. She knew that Jiangling must not be far from Jiangnan, or part of that famous bustling place, the southern region. If she followed this young man, she would arrive at pleasant places. On the contrary, she had seen her teacher's map, and knew that Kaifeng was located in Henan, which belonged to the northern region, arguably the center of Zhongyuan itself. The 'Xiaojie' referred to was this young man's younger sister, and seemed to be regarded as a child by her older brother. Her name consisted of two 'Su' characters repeated. It seemed that this girl was quite interesting. The affairs in Henan were considered 'easy' by these people, but required her presence, which meant that their family was highly valued by people.

At this time, Ki Son-yeo basically had no definite goal. She felt that having a friend of the same age or slightly older, who was also a girl, would certainly be very pleasant. So she then asked for directions to Kaifeng.

Then, with a cheerful stride, she continued her journey to Kaifeng, a bow and arrows on her back, a long sword in her left hand.

## *Kaifeng, July 1327: A Little Fairy Enters Kaifeng*

Still biting into the mantou she'd bought on Kaifeng's outer ring road, Qi Shengniang stepped through the west gate. Several guards eyed the bow and arrows, and the sword in her left hand, with suspicion. One of them stepped forward, extending his arms, and asked, "Where are you going?"

Surprised, Qi Shengniang replied, "Entering Kaifeng. Dage (Big Brother), why?"

Under Yuan Dynasty regulations, descendants of the Han people were forbidden from carrying weapons and riding horses. Although this rule wasn't strictly intended for anti-Han or other ethnic reasons, it was generally perceived that way by most people. Yesün Temür, who ascended the throne with a background of rebellion, always sought to gain as much support as possible for his government. Therefore, during his leadership, this rule had indeed become somewhat relaxed, but it was by no means abolished. A Han descendant could be an envoy from another local government, who would be temporarily allowed to carry weapons. However, the appearance of the young girl before him was certainly far from that of a military envoy from anywhere. Thus, the guard then said, "You may, but first leave your weapons behind!"

Even more surprised, Qi Shengniang then asked innocently, "Why?"

"Aiyooo!" the officer exclaimed, laughing, "*Chou Yatou*[^chou-yatou], are you truly ignorant, or just pretending to be? *Manzi*[^manzi] are not allowed to carry weapons!"

[^manzi]: Man Zi (蠻子), "Barbarian" or "Backward person", aka "Uncivilized".
[^chou-yatou]: Chou Yatou (臭丫頭), can be translated more simply as "Stinky brat", regardless of gender. Actually "Yatou" here refers to a girl.

At this moment, Qi Shengniang just realized that her appearance as a Han person here was greatly disadvantaging her. Yet, even in Haengju, if they faced Yuan Dynasty officials, common folk received similar treatment. She had indeed heard her master's teachings about the Yuan Dynasty's caste system, which categorized Goryeo descendants like herself as third rank, while the Han people occupied the lowest rank. However, she had absolutely no idea that in Zhongyuan, such rules were truly enforced. She felt offended and intended to hurl sharp words.

But, the next second, to the guard's surprise, his recent words attracted the attention of everyone nearby, who also became offended, even though the words weren't directed at them. A large man, who looked like a pig butcher, rolled up his sleeves and said sarcastically, "*Da Xiansheng* (Great Master), you probably don't know this either. Right now, Huang Shang greatly dislikes the airs of those *Lamas*, and has even forbidden them from coming to Zhongyuan. Previously, they bothered the villagers in our homes. Our Village Head also allows us to carry weapons, so we won't be troubled by people like those *Lamas*. This little sister is a girl; what if she gets harassed?" As he spoke, he stepped forward, standing in front of Ki Son-yeo, intending to protect her.

This stance aroused the guard's suspicion. He had initially considered allowing Qi Shengniang to pass. He was not unaware that Emperor Yesün Temür had forbidden Tibetan monks from entering Zhongyuan because they often acted arbitrarily and disturbed the peace of the common people. Yesün Temür not only disregarded the authority of the Tibetan monks, who had previously been highly favored by Kublai Khan, but also ignored the tradition of worshipping the Heavenly God of the Mongol tribes! So far, during his reign, it was Christian and Muslim clerics who received the most attention.

Nevertheless, if this young girl turned out to be an agent of the man resembling a butcher or his companions, and if the weapons she carried belonged to an adult, wouldn't a major disturbance occur in their city? He said, "Who are you? What is your relationship with this brat?"

Seeing the ominous turn of events, Qi Shengniang hurriedly extended her left hand, blocking between the two people she thought were about to fight, and said, "Hey, Dage (Big Brother), let's just drop it. If you want my sword, just take it."

The guard then took Qi Shengniang's long sword. "And your bow?" He extended his hand, demanding the weapon.

"Dage," Qi Shengniang said, "This bow and arrows are for hunting in the forest. Sometimes I don't have money to buy food..."

But the guard ignored her explanation and intended to forcefully take her bow. Instinctively, Qi Shengniang's left hand moved to block the guard's hand. At the same time, her right palm sent a strike towards her opponent's stomach. Not expecting this young girl to resist in such a way, the guard was surprised. Qi Shengniang's internal energy was not yet very strong. But the blow was delivered very quickly, and this move she practiced diligently every day, according to her master's teachings. As a result, when Qi Shengniang's palm landed squarely, the guard was pushed back several steps, feeling a sharp pain in his stomach, and he gasped for breath.

This reaction drew admiration from the people around them, who had been observing what was happening. A burst of applause erupted as the people expressed their delight at seeing the guard, whom they considered arrogant, groaning in pain.

The guard, shifting from embarrassment to fury, yelled, "Chou Yatou (brat)!" then moved quickly to seize Qi Shengniang's wrist with the intention of capturing her, no longer caring that his opponent was just a young girl.

To his surprise, when his hand landed on her wrist, the girl rotated her wrist and then used that very hand to deliver another palm strike towards his face. This time the blow landed more perfectly, though not very hard.

At that critical moment, as the atmosphere began to heat up, a boy's voice was heard from behind Qi Shengniang, "Stop!"

Several uniformed guards appeared, making way for a boy who seemed to be Qi Shengniang's age, stepping calmly towards the source of the commotion, and saying, "This child is my friend, let her pass!"

All the guards present bowed respectfully, "Gongzi (Young Master)!"

The next event left Qi Shengniang bewildered. Everyone now bowed respectfully to greet this boy in the same manner, "Gongzi!" The boy merely smiled kindly at them, saying, "This is just a misunderstanding. This young lady is a servant from our household. I told her to come ahead of me to deliver news to my uncle."

Now, the guard looked at Qi Shengniang in a new light. "No wonder this girl's kung fu is so good," he said. "Gongzi, I am truly sorry, we did not know."

"It's no problem."

Qi Shengniang, still bewildered, then followed the young man on foot, entering the city gate with his attendants. After they had walked some distance, the young man asked, "Guniang (Miss), what is your name?"

Without hesitation, the girl replied, "Qi Shengniang."

"You must not be from around here," the young man said again, smiling kindly. "Next time, be careful when entering a city with weapons, even just arrows and a bow. It can be forbidden. Here in Henan, the rules are actually not as strict as in Dadu, but you still shouldn't bring a sword into the city. Where is your home?"

This time, Qi Shengniang lightly lied, "Jiangnan," then asked, observing the young man who was roughly her age. His face was somewhat square; he didn't appear to be Han, but the Han language he spoke was excellent. He must be the child of a rich family who received a perfect education from a young age. "Hey, you haven't told me your name."

The young man now smiled, saying lightly, "You may call me Togto'a."

---

## *Kaifeng, July 1327: Little Fairy Met Christian Fryer and Pastor*

The hustle and bustle of Kaifeng left Qi Shengniang in awe. This city was colorful; it seemed all sorts of people were here. It was unlike Haengju, and certainly unlike Dengzhou. She had heard that Dadu contained an even greater variety of people. For the first time, she saw a foreign man, with a prominent nose, thin lips, a very tall stature, fair skin, a thick beard, wearing clothes that seemed very strange to her. His robe was made of coarse, dark brown fabric. He spoke Han with considerable fluency, but his accent sounded peculiar. The man was sitting in a simple tavern in Kaifeng, speaking with another foreign man, who wore a tall black hat, his beard very long. Qi Shengniang first saw him through the wide, open tavern window, entering the tavern from the street, his beard fluttering in the wind. To her, this sight was very amusing, and she had to suppress her laughter so that the noodles she was swallowing wouldn't make her choke.

Now, she heard the first man say to the tall-hatted man, "Jiaoshi (Teacher), so this is where Marco Polo and his family used to live?"

"That's right," his interlocutor replied, taking a sip of wine, then pinching off a piece of Mongolian round bread. "But you'd much prefer living in Quanzhou. Our people are far more numerous there. And there are also followers of the Ming Jiao (Bright Cult)."

"Ming Jiao?" the first man asked. "You mean the teaching that Agostin of Hippo followed before he was baptized?"

"Exactly!" his friend said, laughing. "Here, they initially called it 'Moni Jiao' (Manichaeism), which indeed resembles its founder's name, Mani! But then, for some reason, they nicknamed them 'Mo Jiao' (Demonic Teachings)!"

Both men then laughed together, seemingly understanding what amused them, which Qi Shengniang couldn't comprehend at all.

"So this is why they then made up the name 'Ming Jiao'?" the first man, still chuckling, asked. "That's actually good—Bright Teaching, does that mean they might even call Mani 'Ming Wang' (King of Light)?"

"Ah!" his friend said, pointing his finger at the first man. "Andreas, you sometimes make me envious. Your Han is clearly worse, but you always come up with amazing terms I've never found before. This," he lowered his voice, leaning closer to his companion, "has indeed begun to emerge recently... this term... which I think is a bit dangerous, if the government hears it..."

The man named Andreas, clearly much younger than the tall-hatted one, looked surprised and whispered, "Who first said that?"

The older man shrugged, saying, "About that, Laona (this old monk) also doesn't know; it could be anyone among the common folk. You know, this kind of thing doesn't just happen here; it's common where I come from too. As long as it's not stirred up by others for their own gain, it's actually quite normal."

Qi Shengniang felt surprised. "Is this tall-hatted man a monk?" she thought.

Then she heard the man called Andreas reply, "Jiaoshi (Teacher) surely knows... usually it will be stirred up..." his face looked worried. "Xiaoseng (this little monk) thinks that next, the term Mingjun (Bright Army) will surely emerge, and after that, it seems we should prepare for chaos..."

From behind the door, a woman entered with a boy, about five years old, approaching their table. She sat next to the older man, greeting, "Frater Andreas, I thought you were leaving today?"

"Ah, Furen (Madam), I'm still in Henan for a while; there's no news yet from my friend who's also heading here," Andreas replied, laughing, calling the boy to sit by his side. "You're bothering your parents, this table is small."

The boy laughed cheerfully, looking at the older man, who turned out to be his father. "Die (Father), mother said we're going to Fujian, is that true?"

"Do you like that?" his father asked. "Your friends will be more numerous there."

Now Qi Shengniang's question was answered. Apparently, these two men were just using terms like 'Xiaoseng' and 'Laona' jokingly. The proof was that the man who called himself an 'old monk' had a wife and child. She chuckled to herself.

The wife of the man who called himself 'Laona' was clearly Han, speaking with an accent that sounded somewhat strange to Qi Shengniang's ears, some words seeming to come through her nose. It appeared she herself hailed from the region previously called 'Fujian' or Quanzhou. Their son's appearance was clearly a mix of the two, with a prominent nose and thin lips like his father, but eyes more like his mother's.

The woman said to Andreas, "Frater, you might be interested in trying this; it tastes very spicy, you can eat it! My friends say it was brought from Java; it seems to be an interesting spice to mix into cooking. Do you think its seeds could be planted here?"

Andreas took the dried plant offered to him, pinched off a little, sniffed it, before biting into it, and said, "Hmm! This tastes like pepper, but it's not pepper. It might be useful for medicine. Furen, could you spare a little? I don't think Marco Polo ever went to Java, but Kublai Khan did send a fleet there."

They then discussed things Qi Shengniang couldn't understand, though she became curious about what Andreas was tasting. It seemed like an interesting cooking spice. Soon after, they left the tavern, and Qi Shengniang herself intended to pay for her food and leave, when another group appeared at the door.

A beautiful girl, about fifteen years old, entered with several men who appeared to be martial arts experts, and sat at a table near the cashier. The girl said, "How dare they! They tried to snatch our goods? Luckily Shushu (Uncle) moved quickly just now."

Then the man referred to as 'Shushu' replied, "Susu, don't be afraid. They're just petty thieves..."

Having already turned towards the door after paying for her meal, Qi Shengniang's steps halted for a moment. Wasn't this the 'Xiaojie' she had wanted to meet? But how could she introduce herself?

While she was still thinking, her eyes suddenly caught sight of another group approaching the tavern. A boy, also her age, walked ahead of several of his bodyguards armed with long swords. These guards were clearly from Goryeo, and *the round-faced boy was none other than Wang Jeong*!

Damn it, Qi Shengniang thought, why was this *stinky brat*[^chou-xiaozi] here?

[^chou-xiaozi]: Chou Xiaozi (臭小子), can be translated as "Stinky brat", ignoring gender. Actually 'Xiaozi' refers to a boy.

She hurriedly turned, facing the cashier's table, pretending to borrow writing utensils. Listening intently, she managed to catch Wang Jeong speaking to one of his guards. Apparently, he was very interested upon seeing Yin Susu and said something that no one else there could understand, but he was completely unaware that she—Ki Son-yeo, who was also Goryeo — was present! She quickly made use of the writing tools she borrowed, rapidly writing a line in Han: "Those Goryeo people want to kidnap you." then whispered to the tavern owner, "Give this letter to the Xiaojie who just entered; do not look at anyone else."

Without waiting for a reply, she then turned and slipped out of the tavern, unnoticed by Wang Jeong's guards who were busy talking to their young master.
