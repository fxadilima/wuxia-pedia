# About Wuxia-pedia Repo

This *repository* is [online](https://fxadilima.github.io/wuxia-pedia "Follow that link"), so you can read my stories more conveniently.

**Wuxiapedia** is an attempt to provide online informations about ***Wuxia**, not only he stories (which mostly based on Jin Yong's original works), but also common terms used by Jin Yong and other authors.

Because I am Indonesian, I used to read Indonesian `Wuxia` authors, like [Kho Ping Hoo](), or Gan KL, but they used Hokkien character naming and terminologies, which often confusing if we watch the same stories adaptation. So I translate it into English and Indonesian using modern term (Pinyin).
